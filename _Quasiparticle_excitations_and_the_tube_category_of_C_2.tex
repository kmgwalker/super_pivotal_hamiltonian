\section{Quasiparticle excitations and the tube category of $C_2$} \label{C2_quasiparticles}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we identify the quasiparticle excitations 
in the $C_2$ theory.
We will discuss the quasiparticles in the theory, their fusion rules, their statistics, and the 
modular transformations of the ground states on the torus.
We will identify the excitations using a fermionic generalization of a device known as the {\it tube category}. 
We will briefly review the tube category as applied to the $C_2$ theory below; 
for a more detailed overview and for an explanation of why the fermionic version of the tube category computes the excitations, 
we refer the reader to Section \ref{more_on_tubes}, where we discuss the construction in full generality. 

%As mentioned in the introduction, it is premature to call the objects in the tube category ``excitations'' until 
%we have defined a Hamiltonian that produces the ground states of the fermionic string-net TQFTs 
%we are studying and shown that that the excitation spectrum of this Hamiltonian is reproduced by the 
%objects of the tube category, 
%However, we should reiterate that what we're about to say makes sense without the Hamiltonian point of view (indeed, 
%the paper would make perfectly good sense if we ignored Hamiltonians altogether), and 
%exists as a legitimate mathematical construction in its own right 
%within the self-contained world of fermionic TQFTs. 
%For the benefit of more physically-inclined readers 
%we will use the ``Hamiltonian/ground-state/excitation'' terminology 
%in this section, although not until Section \ref{Super_pivotal_Hamiltonian} will we describe a Hamiltonian whose 
%ground state is isomorphic to the Hilbert space of this string net model.

For the benefit of more physically-inclined readers 
we will use the ``Hamiltonian/ground-state/excitation'' terminology 
in this section, 
even though (as discussed in the introduction) we will not define the relevant Hamiltonian until Section \ref{Super_pivotal_Hamiltonian}.
The constructions in this section all take place within the self-contained world of TQFTs defined via string nets;
the Hamiltonian/ground-state/excitation interpretation is optional.

%%KW: This paragraph seems too dense to me.  Is it necessary?
%The setting for examining a collection of $n$ excitations in a given topological phase is a manifold with $n$ circular punctures, 
%with an excitation localized at the location of each puncture. 
%The tube category $\tube(C_2)$ contains all spin tubes with $C_2$ string-nets drawn on their surfaces modulo local relations, 
%and $\tube(C_2)$ acts on the punctures by gluing in tubes to each puncture. 
%Two tubes $a$ and $b$ can be composed by stacking $a$ on top of $b$, with the stacking operation playing the role of a 
%multiplication law in an algebra. 
%Determining the spectrum of excitations in the $C_2$ theory can thus be done by writing down a collection of independent 
%spin-structure-equipped tubes with string nets drawn on their surfaces, 
%finding their algebraic behavior under stacking, and computing the minimal idempotents of the resulting algebra. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Finding the quasiparticle excitations}   \label{C2excitations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We now turn to a detailed study of the tube category for $C_2$. 
The objects of $\tube(C_2)$ are given by spin circles with a finite number of marked points 
labeled by simple objects of $C_2$.
There are two spin structures on the circle: bounding (anti-periodic boundary conditions; non-vortex) and 
non-bounding (periodic boundary conditions; vortex).
%Each object in $\tube(C_2)$ thus possesses an additional label identifying the spin structure of the underlying circle. 
Each object in $\tube(C_2)$ thus determines a choice of spin structure of the underlying circle. 

It suffices to consider only objects with at most one labeled point.
This is because any other object is isomorphic to a direct sum of objects with at most one labeled point.
Note also that an object with a point labeled by $\mathds{1}$ (the trivial object of $C_2$)
is isomorphic to the object obtained by erasing that marked point.
In particular, a circle with no marked points is isomorphic to a circle with a single point labeled by $\mathds{1}$.


Since there are two simple objects in $C_2$, 
for a fixed spin structure there are only two possible labels that can be assigned to a marked point,
\begin{align}
\underset{\mathds{1}}{\TubeBCx{B}} \quad \quad \quad \underset{\beta}{\TubeBCx{B}} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \underset{\mathds{1}}{\TubeBCx{N}} \quad \quad \quad \underset{\beta}{\TubeBCx{N}}
\end{align}
where $B$, $N$ denote bounding and non-bounding spin structures respectively. 

Morphisms of $\tube(C_2)$ are 
defined to be cylinders (which we will draw as annuli) decorated by $C_2$ string-nets.
A given morphism $a\ra b$ is thus an annulus whose outer (inner) boundary conditions are determined by the object $a$ ($b$). 

After applying local relations (F-moves, dot-cancellations, removing trivial loops), 
an arbitrary string-net diagram on any tube can be reduced to a linear 
combination of the following diagrams:
\begin{align}
\label{mortube}
\text{mor}(\underset{\mathds{1}}{\TubeBCx{J}} \rightarrow \underset{\mathds{1}}{\TubeBCx{J}}) &= \mathbb{C}\left[ \Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{J} ,  \Fubex{\FubesXsA}{J}, \Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{J} \right] \\
\text{mor}(\underset{\beta}{\TubeBCx{J}} \rightarrow \underset{\beta}{\TubeBCx{J}}) &= \mathbb{C}\left[   \Fubex{\FubeXssA}{J} ,  \Fubex{\FubessXA}{J}, \Fubex{\FubeXsdsA}{J} , \Fubex{\FubessdXA}{J} \right] \\
\\
\text{mor}(\underset{\mathds{1}}{\TubeBCx{B}} \rightarrow \underset{\beta}{\TubeBCx{N}}) &= 0 \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{mor}(\underset{\beta}{\TubeBCx{N}} \rightarrow \underset{\mathds{1}}{\TubeBCx{B}}) = 0
\end{align}
with $J =B$ for bounding spin structure, and $J =N$ for non-bounding spin structure. 
In the first row we have listed all possible tubes which take the trivial boundary condition back to itself, 
and in the second row the tubes which take the $\beta$ marked point back to itself.
Notice that all non-zero tubes for $C_2$ have the same label at the two marked points.
For general input categories this won't happen; see Sections \ref{so36} and \ref{halfesix} for examples.



Depending on the spin structure on the annulus, some of the above diagrams may be zero.
With a bounding spin structure, a fermionic dot picks up a factor of $-1$ if it moves around the annulus.
On the other hand a fermionic dot picks up a factor of $+1$ if it moves around the annulus with non-bounding spin structure.

As we said above, not every string diagram in the annulus is consistent with a given spin structure.
For example,
\begin{align}
\label{BoundingNullVector}
\Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{B}\;  = - \; \Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{B} \implies \Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{B} = 0,
\end{align}
where we have simply pulled the fermion around the non-contractible loop on the tube. 
A non-bounding tube with a horizontal $\beta$ line is also zero, since
\begin{align}
\label{non-boundingNullVector}
\Fubex{\FubesXsA}{N}\; =\; A^{-4} \Fubex{\FubesXsaA}{N} \; = A^{-4} \Fubex{\FubesXscA}{N} \; = \; -\Fubex{\FubesXsA}{N}
\end{align}
Where in the second step we have dragged one of the two fermions around the annulus.
All other tubes are nonzero for both spin structures, and so a complete basis for tubes in the bounding sector is given by
\begin{align}
 \label{atubes}
\tube^B_{\unit \rightarrow \unit} &= \mathbb{C} \left[\Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{B}  ,\Fubex{\FubesXsA}{B}\right]\\
\tube^B_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}  &=  \mathbb{C} \left[\Fubex{\FubeXssA}{B}  ,\Fubex{\FubessXA}{B},\Fubex{\FubeXsdsA}{B},\Fubex{\FubessdXA}{B}\right]
\end{align}
while a basis for the non-bounding sector is given by
\begin{align}
\label{ptubes}
\tube_{\unit \rightarrow \unit}^N &= \mathbb{C}\left[ \Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{N}  ,\Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{N} \right]\\
\tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^N &= \mathbb{C}\left[ \Fubex{\FubeXssA}{N}  ,\Fubex{\FubessXA}{N} ,\Fubex{\FubeXsdsA}{N} ,\Fubex{\FubessdXA}{N}  \right]
\end{align}

The multiplication operation in the tube category is given by stacking tubes on top of one another 
and simplifying the resulting tube using local relations.  
For example, in the non-bounding sector we have
\begin{align}
\label{OddOddC2Stack}
\Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{N} \;  \cdot  \; \Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{N}  \;=\; \Fubex{\FubesddXsA}{N} \;=\; \frac{1}{d} \left(
\Fubex{\RDotTwobA}{N}
+ A^{-4} \Fubex{\RDotTwocA}{N}  \right) \; = \; 2 \Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{N}
\end{align}
%%KW I think we can explain the cdot notation in the notation summary table
%\kw{Using $\times$ for composition in a category is a little weird/unconventional.
%We might want to change to $\bullet$ or $\cdot$.
%\dave{What about using $\circ$? I think we sometimes use this for composition of morphisms.}}
%\kw{$\circ$ is common, but is always used with the ``function" convention for ordering morphisms,
%rather than the ``arrow" convention which we use here.}
%\dave{Ok. I don't mind which dot we use.}
%\kw{I propose we go with cdot, and maybe add a quick explanation before we first use it.}
%\dave{Sounds good. 
%I made the change to the equation.
%How about we replace `For example...Õ by: 
%We denote the multiplication operation by a $\cdot$, 
%and glue the first tube into the inner circle of the second, 
%as the following example illustrates,}

Note that since the spin structures on two tubes being fused must agree on the boundary 
at which they are fused, non-bounding tubes can only be stacked on top of non-bounding tubes, 
and similarly for bounding tubes.



Relations like the ones above allow us to find the (isomorphism classes of) minimal idempotents of the tube category. 
First, we turn to an analysis of tubes with bounding spin structure. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Non-vortex spin structure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us first examine the tubes with no charge\footnote{We define the ``charge'' of a tube to be the label of the 
marked point of the upper boundary of the tube, so that tubes in $\tube_{a \rightarrow b}$ have charge $b$. 
This is slightly misleading however, because charge is not a good quantum number: in more general theories, 
$\tube_{a \ra b}$ will be nonzero even when $a\neq b$. 
%We will also see examples of theories in which certain 
%equivalence classes of excitations contain tubes of different charge (a non-fermionic version of this is the 
%doubled Fibonacci theory).
}, that is, cylinders 
with bounding spin structures and empty boundary conditions on both their top and bottom, which are the cylinders in $\tube^B_{\unit \rightarrow \unit}$. 
We see that this algeba \eqref{atubes} has two even generators, and so as a vector space
\begin{align}
\tube^B_{\unit \rightarrow \unit} \cong \mathbb{C}^{2|0}
\end{align}
There is only one possible super algebra structure on $\mathbb{C}^{2|0}$; it is the sum of two trivial 1-dimensional algebras
$\End(\cc)\oplus \End(\cc)$ (or $\cc \oplus \cc$ for short, where here $\cc$ denotes a 1-dimensional 
algebra rather than a 1-dimensional vector space).
This sector therefore contains two minimal idempotents, which we will call $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$.
Explicitly, they are 
\be
m_\unit = \frac{1}{2}\left( \Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{B} \; +\; \frac{1}{d}\Fubex{\FubesXsA}{B}\right),\qquad 
m_\psi = \frac{1}{2} \left( \Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{B} \; -\; \frac{1}{d} \Fubex{\FubesXsA}{B}\right).\ee
One can check that the action of any element from $\tube_{\unit \rightarrow \unit}^B$
on both $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$ is simply scalar multiplication. 


Now we turn to the endomorphism algebra $\tube^B_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}$, defined in \eqref{atubes}, 
of charged tubes: those whose top and bottom 
boundary conditions consist of a single marked $\beta$ point. 
There are two non-zero even tubes and two non-zero odd tubes, hence as a vector space we have,
\begin{align}
\tube^B_{\beta \rightarrow \beta} \cong \cc^{2|2}.
\end{align}
This means that as an algebra $\tube^B_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}$ is either 
$\cl_2$ (a.k.a.\ $\End(\cc^{1|1})$) or $\cl_1\oplus \cl_1$. 

To figure out which case we have, we begin by writing down the multiplication rules. 
By using the local relations in the $C_2$ theory we can work out the multiplication table, 
which is presented in the following table. 
In the table, $A\times B$ means ``stack $A$ (left most column) on top of $B$ (top most row)''. 
For multiplications involving odd tubes, we always take fermions in the $A$ tube to have a 
higher ordering than the fermions in the $B$ tube. 

\be

\begin{tabular}{c | r r r r r}
$\times$ in $\tube^B_{\beta\rightarrow \beta} \vphantom{\scale{1.3}{\VerticalSpace}}$          & $\FubeXssA $ & $\FubeXsdsA $ & $\FubessXA $&$ \FubessdXA$  \\
\hline
$\FubeXssA$ & $\FubeXssA$ & $\ \FubeXsdsA$  & $\FubessXA$ & $\FubessdXA$  \\

$\FubessdXA    $&$ \FubessdXA $&$ A^{4}\FubessXA $&$ A^2 \FubeXsdsA $&$ A^6\FubeXssA$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee


Since the multiplication table for $\tube_\beta^B$ is non-abelian, 
as an algebra it must be $\cl_2$, as the other possibility (namely 
$\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$) is abelian. 
In order to show that the previous table is indeed the multiplication table of $\cl_2$, 
one can identify,
\begin{align}
1 = \Fubex{\FubeXssA}{B} \qquad \gamma_1 = A^6 \Fubex{\FubeXsdsA}{B} \qquad \gamma_2 = A^5  \Fubex{\FubessdXA}{B} 
\end{align}
and check that the odd generators $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ satisfy $\gamma_1^2 = \gamma_2^2 = 1$, and $\{ \gamma_i, \gamma_j \} = 2 \delta_{ij}$. 
These are precisely the defining relations of $\cl_2 \cong \langle 1, \gamma_1,\gamma_2 \rangle$, and so we have $\tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^B \cong \cl_2$.


The super algebra $\cl_2$ contains exactly two minimal idempotents, which we will call $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\sigma^-$.
Explicitly,
\begin{align}
m_\sigma^{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \Fubex{\FubeXssA}{B} \pm  A^{3}\Fubex{\FubessXA}{B} \right) .
\end{align}
These two idempotents are isomorphic, in the sense that there exist 
endomorphisms (tubes) $u$ and $v$ such that $uv = m_\sigma^+$
and $vu = m_\sigma^-$\footnote{Indeed this must be the case, since $\cl_2$ is Morita equivalent to $\cc$, 
which has only one minimal idempotent.}.
%%KW: I don't understand this.  Is it necessary?  Would it make more sense to give an explicit u and v?
%This isomorphism is realized by creating a fermion on the top of the $\gamma_2$ tube (through the 
%isomorphism given by left multiplication by $\gamma_1$), dragging it around the $\gamma_2$ 
%tube to the bottom, and then annihilating it (through the isomorphism given by right 
%multiplication by $\gamma_1$)
The existence of this isomorphism means that $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\sigma^-$ correspond to isomorphic simple 
modules and so represent the same
quasiparticle type.
Note that in this case $u$ and $v$ are necessarily odd; we say that $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\sigma^-$ are {\it oddly} isomorphic.
When doing calculations we fix a particular representative of the $m_\sigma^\pm$ 
equivalence class, which we will choose to be $m_\sigma^+$. 




\subsubsection{Vortex spin structure} 
As in the last section, we first examine the endomorphism algebra $\tube^N_{\unit \rightarrow \unit}$, 
consisting of tubes with no charge and non-bounding spin structure.
As we saw in \eqref{ptubes}, this algebra is two dimensional, and generated by a single even vector 
and a single odd vector, so as a vector space we have
\be \tube^N_{\unit \rightarrow \unit } \cong \cc^{1|1}
\ee
The only possible algebra structure on $\cc^{1|1}$ is $\cl_1$. 
$\cl_1 = \langle 1,\gamma\rangle$ has only one simple module, namely $\cc^{1|1}$ with the matrix representation 
$\rho(1) = \sigma^0,\rho(\gamma)=\sigma^x$. 
Therefore, this endomorphism algebra will support only one quasiparticle. Since idempotents must always be even, 
the explicit presentation of this quasiparticle is simply the empty tube. We will denote this quasiparticle by $q_\sigma$:
\be q_\sigma = \Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{N} \ee


Now we examine the charge sector, corresponding to the algebra $\tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^N$ 
of vortex tubes with nontrivial charge. 
As we have seen in \eqref{ptubes} this subalgebra again has two even generators and two odd generators, 
and so as a vector space:
\be \tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^N \cong \cc^{2|2} \ee
Therefore, as an algebra, we must have $\tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^N \cong \cl_2$ or $\tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^N \cong \cl_1\oplus\cl_1$. 
To determine which choice is correct, we work out the multiplication table, which is
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | r r r r r}
$\times$ in $\tube^N_{\beta\rightarrow \beta} \vphantom{\scale{1.3}{\VerticalSpace}}$          & $\FubeXssA $ & $\FubeXsdsA $ & $\FubessXA $&$ \FubessdXA$  \\
\hline
$\FubeXssA$ & $\FubeXssA$ & $\ \FubeXsdsA$  & $\FubessXA$ & $\FubessdXA$  \\

$\FubeXsdsA$ & $\FubeXsdsA $& $A^{4}\FubeXssA$ & $\FubessdXA $& $A^{4}\FubessXA  $\\

$\FubessXA$   & $\FubessXA $&$ \FubessdXA  $&$A^{6}\FubeXssA $&$A^{6}\FubeXsdsA $\\

$\FubessdXA    $&$ \FubessdXA $&$ A^{4}\FubessXA $&$ A^6 \FubeXsdsA $&$ A^{10}\FubeXssA$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee
Since the multiplication table is abelian, we must have $\tube_\beta^N \cong \cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ (as the other choice, $\cl_2$, is non-abelian). 
To see this explicitly, we make the identifications
\be \unit^\pm = \frac{1}{2}\left ( \Fubex{\FubeXssA}{N}  \pm A^5\Fubex{\FubessXA}{N} \right),\qquad   \gamma^\pm = \frac{A^6}{2}\left ( \Fubex{\FubeXsdsA}{N}  \pm A^5\Fubex{\FubessdXA}{N} \right).\ee
If we then re-write the multiplication table for $\tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^N$ in terms of these generators, 
we see that it is indeed isomorphic to $\langle \unit^+ ,\gamma^+\rangle \oplus \langle \unit^- , \gamma^-\rangle =\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$, with $(\gamma^\pm)^2 = \unit^\pm$. 
We therefore have two (non-isomorphic) idempotents, $q_\unit = \unit^+$ and $q_\psi = \unit^-$.
Thus, the $\tube_{\beta \rightarrow \beta}^N$ 
endomorphism algebra gives rise to two q-type quasiparticles. (Recall that a q-type object is a simple
object whose endomorphism algebra is $\cc^{1|1}$. Simple 
objects whose endomorphism algebras are isomorphic to $\cc$ are referred to as m-type.)

\medskip

To summarize, we have found six types of quasiparticles in the theory: three non-vortex quasiparticles 
associated with tubes possessing bounding spin structures, and three vortex quasiparticles associated 
with tubes possessing non-bounding spin structures. 
They are displayed in Table \ref{CTwoParticles}.
The quantum dimension of these excitations can be computed 
%\kw{how does that go? 
%\dave{Perhaps the same way we do for bosonic theories. 
%Compute the dimension of the vector space as a function of the number of strands.
%Ethan is that true? Or did you have something else in mind?}
%\ethan{yeah, by either finding eigenvalues of fusion matrices, or by computing asymptotic dimensions
%of fusion spaces. Not sure if it'll work for arbitrary fermionic theories though, so I modified the sentence 
%to just talk about tracing} }
by tracing out the 
idempotents associated with each excitation, which we elaborate on in Section \ref{traces_and_innerproducts}. 
The quantum dimensions are displayed in Table \ref{C2Data}.

\subsection{Quasiparticle fusion rules} \label{C2_fusion_rules}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

With all quasiparticles in hand, we are ready to compute their fusion rules. 
We postpone a more general discussion of how to compute fusion rules in fermionic theories to Section \ref{fusion_rules}, 
and in this section restrict ourselves to working out examples for the $C_2$ theory. 


%The quasiparticles -- or primitive idempotents -- displayed in Table \ref{CTwoParticles} naturally define 
%simple modules of the tube category, which are the images of the primitive idempotents.
%These simple modules are irreducible representations 
%of the tube category, and so to each quasiparticle $a$ we can construct an irreducible representation, 
%which we will also denote as $a$. 

Recall that to each minimal idempotent $e$ we can associate an irreducible module 
(a.k.a.\ irreducible representation) $M_e$ as follows.
Let $\mct$ denote the tube category, and let $x$ be object
of $\mct$ which hosts $e$ (i.e.\ $e\in \End(x)$).
To each object $y$ of $\mct$, the module $M_e$ associates the subspace of $\mor(x\to y)$ consisting of morphisms
of the form $ef$, where $e$ is our chosen idempotent and $f$ is an arbitrary morphism from $x$ to $y$.
We can express this compactly as
\be
	M_e = e\mct .
\ee
It is easy to check that if $e$ and $e'$ are isomorphic idempotents, then $M_e$ and $M_{e'}$ are isomorphic modules, and conversely.
Geometrically, the module $M_e$ consists of tubes with $e$ fixed at one end and arbitrary string nets ($f$ above)
at the other end.

We will frequently simplify notation and denote both the idempotent $e$ and the corresponding module $M_e$ as simply $e$.

%Even after modding out by local relations, there will often exist several irreducible representations which are 
%isomorphic to one another, the collection of which form a single isomorphism class, 
%The choice of representative affects the explicit representation of the fusion space, but does not affect the 
%values of any gauge invariant quantities. 
%For example, the idempotent given by ${m_\sigma^+}$ constitutes a choice of representative of the isomorphism 
%class formed by $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\sigma^-$, but we could have just as easily chosen ${m_\sigma^-}$ as a representative.

It is important to note that there many idempotents within a given equivalence class,
and these idempotents might be hosted at different objects.
Furthermore, the isomorphism relating two idempotents might be odd
(i.e.\ it reverses fermion parity).
Despite these differences, all of the idempotents within an equivalence class should be thought of as representing the same
anyon type.
To do calculations, we must choose a particular idempotent within the equivalence class.
This is analogous to a gauge choice.
For example, the idempotent given by ${m_\sigma^+}$ constitutes a choice of representative of the equivalence 
class containing $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\sigma^-$, but we could have just as easily chosen ${m_\sigma^-}$ as a representative.

%Given two irreps $a$ and $b$, we can form the tensor product representation $a\tp b$, which need not be irreducible.
%Intuitively, forming $a\tp b$ amounts to fusing the quasiparticles $a$ and $b$ together by bringing them close 
%to one another, and ``zooming out'' to view $a$ and $b$ as a single composite quasiparticle. 
%The $\tp$ operation is the usual tensor product of representations when the tube category, viewed as an algebra, 
%comes equipped with a natural tensor product operation. 
%However, to precisely define the $\tp$ operation in general, we need to examine vector spaces on the pair of 
%pants: the tensor product $a \tp b$ is constructed by constructing a pair of pants with 
%boundary conditions on the two ``incoming'' legs determined by $a$ and $b$.
%We will defer a more precise discussion of this to Section \ref{fusion_rules}. 

Given two modules $a$ and $b$ of $\mct$, we can construct a tensor product module $a\tp b$.
Intuitively, forming $a\tp b$ amounts to fusing the quasiparticles $a$ and $b$ together by bringing them close 
to one another, and ``zooming out'' to view $a$ and $b$ as a single composite quasiparticle. 
To make this precise, we can impost the idempotent versions of $a$ and $b$ as boundary conditions on the two inner boundary components
of a twice-punctured disk $P$ (a.k.a.\ pair of pants).
Adding tubes to the outer boundary component of $P$ gives a module for the tube category, and this
module is, by definition $a\tp b$.
We will discuss this in more detail in \ref{fusion_rules}. 

We define the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$ as the space
\be V^{ab}_c \equiv {\rm mor}(c \ra a \tp b).\ee
Geometrically, $V^{ab}_c$ corresponds to the space of all string-net configurations (modulo local relations) 
on a pair of pants whose outgoing legs are labeled by the quasiparticles $a$ and $b$, and whose incoming leg is labelled by $c$. 

One subtle property of fermion theories is that the vector spaces $V^{ab}_c$ are {\it not} 
the vector spaces which appear in the direct sum decomposition of $a\tp b$. 
Instead, we define the fusion rule coefficients $\Delta^{ab}_c$ via\footnote{The $\Delta^{ab}_c$ are 
complex super vector spaces, not numbers.
They are a categorified version of the coefficients used to write a general vector as a linear combination
of basis vectors.}
\be \label{fusion_coeffs_defn} 
	a \tp b \cong \bigoplus_c \Delta^{ab}_ c c,
\ee
where the sum runs over a set of representatives for the equivalence classes of irreducible 
representations (equivalently, of minimal idempotents). 
In bosonic theories $V^{ab}_c = \Delta^{ab}_c$, but in fermionic theories the fusion spaces 
can be larger than the the fusion coefficients:
\be V^{ab}_c \cong \Delta^{ab}_c \tp \End(c).\ee
We demonstrate and elaborate on this in Section \ref{fusion_rules_and_fusion_spaces}. 

\medskip

We will now illustrate how to compute the fusion spaces with simple examples in the $C_2$ theory. 
Suppose we want to find the fusion rule for $q_\sigma \otimes m_\unit$.
We first note that spin structure considerations on the pair of pants require that any quasiparticle 
appearing in $q_\sigma \tp m_\unit$ be a vortex-type quasiparticle (one with a non-bounding spin structure). 
Furthermore, since both $m_\unit$ and $q_\sigma$ have no charge (no $\beta$ lines fixed to the boundaries of their tubes), 
we know that their fusion products cannot have any charge.
Since $q_\sigma$ is the only vortex-type quasi particle with no charge we know that it is the only particle 
which can appear in the tensor product of $q_\sigma$ and $m_\unit$.
By searching for pants invariant under the applications of the appropriate idempotents, we see that the super vector space 
$V^{q_\sigma m_\unit}_{q_\sigma}$ is isomorphic to $\cc^{1|1}$, with the even subspace generated by a single even vector
\begin{align}
[V^{q_\sigma m_1}_{q_\sigma}]^0 = \left\langle \PantsPAPA \; +\;  \frac{1}{d} \PantsPAsPA \right \rangle
\end{align}
and the odd subspace generated by a single odd vector
\begin{align}
[V^{q_\sigma m_1}_{q_\sigma}]^1 = \left\langle \PantsPsdAPA \; +\;  \frac{1}{d} \PantsPsdAsPA \right \rangle.
\label{apply_odd_endo}
\end{align}
Notice that to find the odd generator from the even one, we apply the odd endomorphism of $q_\sigma$ to the ``exterior'' 
boundary of the pair of pants.
Graphically, this corresponds to taking a $\beta$ loop with a single dot on it and inserting it in a position parallel 
to the outer boundary of the pair of pants. 



A more nontrivial fusion rule is $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma$.
Since $q_\sigma$ has no charge, any quasiparticles appearing in $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma$ must also carry no charge, 
since for the $C_2$ theory charge is a good quantum number. 
Additionally, any quasiparticles in $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma$ must have non-vortex spin structures, so we know that 
only $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$ can appear in $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma$. This lets us work out the fusion spaces explicitly. 
We first work out the fusion space for $V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\unit}$.
The even part is generated by a single vector:
\begin{align}
[V^{q_\sigma  q_\sigma}_{m_\unit}]^0 = \left\langle \PantsPPAA  + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAsA \right \rangle.
\end{align}
As with \eqref{apply_odd_endo}, we find the odd generator by using the odd endomorphism coming from $q_\sigma$:
\begin{align}
[V^{q_\sigma  q_\sigma}_{m_\unit}]^1 =\left \langle \PantsNNda  + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsNNd \right \rangle.
\end{align}
%The same odd vector space is found from applying the odd endomorphism from either of the $q_\sigma$ quasiparticles,
Therefore, $V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\unit} =  [V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_\unit}]^0 \oplus [V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_\unit}]^1 \cong \cc^{1|1}$.
An analogous calculation shows that $V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\psi} \cong \cc^{1|1}$,
and is generated by the two vectors
\begin{align}
V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\psi} =
\left \langle \PantsPPAA  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAsA \right \rangle 
\oplus \left\langle \PantsNNda  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsNNd \right \rangle.
\end{align}
Summarizing, we have $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma \cong \mathbb{C}^{1|1}m_\unit \oplus \mathbb{C}^{1|1} m_\psi$, with $V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\unit} \cong V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\psi}\cong\cc^{1|1}$.

%Again it has both even and odd components. The even part is generated two vectors:
%\begin{align}
%[V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_{\mathds{1}} \oplus m_\psi}]^0 &= \left\langle \PantsPPAA  + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAsA \right \rangle \oplus \left\langle \PantsPPAA  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAsA \right \rangle \\
%&= [V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_\unit}]^0 \oplus [V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_\psi}]^0,
%\end{align}
%while the odd part is also generated by two vectors: 
%\begin{align}
%[V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_{\mathds{1}} \oplus m_\psi}]^1 &= \left\langle \PantsNNda  + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsNNd \right \rangle \oplus \left\langle \PantsNNda  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsNNd \right \rangle \\
%&= [V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_\unit}]^1 \oplus [V^{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}_{m_\psi}]^1,
%\end{align}
%Summarizing, we have $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma \cong \mathbb{C}^{1|1}m_\unit \oplus \mathbb{C}^{1|1} m_\psi$, with $V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\unit} \cong V^{q_\sigma q_\sigma}_{m_\psi}\cong\cc^{1|1}$.

As a final example, we will examine the fusion channel $m_\sigma^{+} \tp m_\psi$. 
Since $m_\sigma^{+}$ has nonzero charge while $m_\psi$ has no charge, anything appearing in $m_\sigma^+ \tp m_\psi$ 
must carry nonzero charge. Additionally, since both $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\psi$ have non-vortex spin structures, 
their fusion products must possess non-vortex spin structures as well. Therefore, they must fuse to $m_\sigma^\pm$. 
Determining the fusion space $V^{m_\sigma^+ m_\psi}_{m_\sigma^\pm}$ thus amounts to identifying string-nets 
on the pair of pants which are invariant under the 
application of $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\psi$ on the inner legs of the pants and invariant under 
the application of $m_\sigma^\pm$ on the outer leg of the pants. 

First apply $m_{\sigma}^+$ and $m_\psi$ on the inner legs, 
and $m_{\sigma}^+$ on the outer leg to a generic linear combination of string nets on the pants. 
By using the linear relation,
\begin{align}
\PantsAstAAsA  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \;  \PantsAsAshAsvtA
\end{align}
one can check that the resulting vector space will be zero dimensional if the the pair of pants has even parity, 
and will be one dimensional if the pair of pants has odd parity, generated as follows:
\begin{align}
V^{m_\sigma^+ m_\psi}_{m_\sigma^+} = \left\langle \PantssvXsvdA -\frac{A^3}{\sqrt{2}}\PantssvtshsvdA + A^3\PantssvtXsvdA  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantssvshsvdA   \right \rangle.
\end{align}
Hence $m_\sigma^+ \tp m_\psi \cong \cc^{0|1} m_\sigma^+$.
Repeating the calculation for $m_\sigma^-$ on the outer leg results in a one dimensional vector 
space if the pair of pants has even parity, and zero otherwise;
$m_\sigma^+ \tp m_\psi \cong \cc^{1|0} m_\sigma^-$.
This reflects the fact that $m_\sigma^-$ is oddly isomorphic to $m_\sigma^+$.
We emphasize that to write the fusion rules, we need to work with actual idempotents, not merely equivalence classes of idempotents.

\PantsAstAAsA  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \;  \PantsAsAshAsvtA

One can check that $m_\psi$ is an eigenstate of the closed sigma loop with eigenvalue $-\sqrt{2}$ and $m_1$ 
is an eigenstate with eigenvalue $+\sqrt{2}$. Hence one finds $m_\sigma^{+} \tp m_\psi  \cong m_\sigma^{-}$. 
However, since we would like to fix a representative of the $m_\sigma^\pm$ isomorphism class to work with, 
we need to express the fusion product in terms of $m_\sigma^+$. 
Since $m^{-}_\sigma$ is oddly isomorphic to $m_\sigma^+$, $m_\sigma^{+} \tp m_\psi$ is oddly isomorphic to $m_\sigma^+$, we find  $V^{m_\sigma^+ m_\psi}_{m_\sigma^+} \cong \cc^{0|1}$.
This generator of this vector space can be obtained simply by using the explicit expressions for the $m_\sigma^+$ and $m_\psi$ idempotents. We find
\begin{align}
V^{m_\sigma^+ m_\psi}_{m_\sigma^+} = \left\langle \PantssvXsvdA -\frac{A^3}{\sqrt{2}}\PantssvtshsvdA + A^3\PantssvtXsvdA  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantssvshsvdA   \right \rangle.

By following the approach outlined in these examples, it is straightforward to write down the table of fusion 
rules in the theory, which we present in Table \ref{fusiontable}. In the table, we list the fusion rule 
coefficients from \eqref{fusion_coeffs_defn}, with the bullets ($\bullet$) representing cases 
where $\Delta^{ab}_c \cong \cc^{1|1}$, and the appearance of $\cc^{0|1}$ indicating a purely odd fusion channel. 
The fusion spaces $V^{ab}_c$ can then be obtained through the use of $V^{ab}_c \cong \Delta^{ab}_c \tp \text{End}(c)$.

\subsubsection{$C_2$ string-nets on the torus} \label{c2_stringnets_torus}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we compute a standard basis for $C_2$ string-nets-modulo-local-relations on spin tori as well 
as the action of the mapping class groupoid (i.e. the modular $S$ and $T$ matrices).

%\kw{I think that if we think carefully about spin structures, the two S matrices are the same.}
%The modular $S$-matrix is related to, but distinct from, the matrix of mutual (braiding) statistics between particles, which 
%captures the braiding data of the quasiparticles in the theory.
%This is distinct from ordinary bosonic topological phases, where the modular $S$-matrix is identical to the matrix of 
%braiding statistics between the quasiparticles in the theory. 
%A discussion of braiding statistics is deferred until Section\ref{mutual_statistics}. 

Because the $C_2$ theory is dependent on the existence of a spin structure, 
in order to talk about ground states on a torus we must first specify the spin structure on the torus.
There are $|H^1(T^2;\zt)|=4$ different spin structures on the torus, obtained by choosing either bounding or non-bounding spin 
structures for two of the torus's three non-contractible cycles 
(with the spin structure along the third non-contractible cycle determined by those of the other two). 
To go from the annulus to the torus we identify the inner and outer circles, and label the different spin structures by 
\begin{align}
\AddDatTorus{\FubeXXXA}{X}{Y}\quad \quad \quad X,Y \in\{ B, N \}
\end{align}
where $X$ and $Y$ specify the spin structure along the azimuthal and radial cycles.
%\kw{I find this graphical notation/convention kind of confusing.
%It looks like you are labeling spin structures on the inner and outer boundary of the annulus.
%One alternative would be a pair of perpendicular line segments (x and y axes), 
%representing the meridian and longitude of the torus, each labeled by B/N.
%(Or a rectangle instead of two line segments.)
%Another possibility is to keep the annulus, but add a radial line segment and move the 
%labeled so that it is clear that one
%labels the drawn circle (boundary of annulus) and the other labels the radial loop.}
%\dave{It's difficult to find one that looks good, and is also compatible with all the annuli we use. 
%What about: 
%}
%\kw{maybe stick with the original notation, but add a figure that shows explicitly the two cycles
%that X and Y are labelling (like your fig above, but also with a circular arrow or something for the B.
%(maybe B and N should be changed to X and Y)}
%\dave{Works for me. Done. See Figure below.}

\end{figure}




If there was no interplay between a chosen spin structure and the string-net pictures drawn on the torus, 
and if the fermion parity of a ground state is fixed by the spin structure 
and the string-net picture drawn on the torus, we would expect $|H_1(T^2;\zt)|=4$ 
degenerate ground states 
for each choice of spin structure, since the $\beta$ lines obey $\zt$ fusion rules. 
We will see that naive guess is incorrect: instead, for each spin structure, 
one of the four putative states is a null vector, meaning that there is only a 
3-dimensional groundstate for each choice spin structure.

We will first use elementary arguments to find a spanning set for each of the four spin tori.
Later, using more sophisticated techniques, we will prove that these spanning sets are in fact bases.

Since $\beta$ lines obey $\zz/2$ fusion rules (see \ref{C2_data_table}), it is easy to see that any string net on a spin torus
is a linear combination of the following seven diagrams:
\be \label{seven_tubes} \Fubex{\FubeXXXA}{},\;  \Fubex{\FubesXsA}{},\;     \Fubex{\FubesdXsA}{},\; 
\Fubex{\FubeXssA}{},\; \Fubex{\FubeXsdsA}{},\; \Fubex{\FubessXA}{}, \; \Fubex{\FubessdXA}{}.
\ee
Indeed, using \eqref{Fmove} and the ability to remove topologically trivial $\beta$ loops, 
we can transform the $\beta$ loops into a standard representative of their
$\zz/2$ homology class.
The resulting loop will be decorated by some number of fermionic dots; using dot cancellation we can assume that the
loop will contain either 0 or 1 dot.
The seven diagrams listed above are the only independent diagrams that remain after applying these relations. 


However, for a given spin structure, some of the diagrams in \eqref{seven_tubes} will be zero.
To determine which of the diagrams are zero, we use the following three obervations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If one of the non-trivial cycles of the torus has an antiperiodic spin structure, then any odd diagram is zero.
	This is because we can translate the entire string net in the direction of the antiperiodic cycle.
	When we arrive back at our starting point, we have picked up a factor of $-1$ from the antiperiodicity.
	Thus odd diagrams are equal to $-1$ times themselves and are therefore zero.
	In particular, the three odd diagrams of \eqref{seven_tubes} are zero in the $BB$, $BN$ and $NB$ spin structures.
	\item If a diagram contains a $\beta$ loop without a dot (even fermion parity), and if that loop inherits the periodic spin structure,
	then the diagram is zero.
	To see this, we create two dots on the loop, slide one around the loop, and then cancel the dots again.
	Because of the Koszul sign, we see that the diagram is equal to $-1$ times itself.
	(If the spin structure along the cycle were antiperiodic, there would be an additional sign to cancel the Koszul sign.)
	In particular, in the $NN$ spin structure all three of the even $\beta$ loops are zero.
	For the $BB$, $BN$ and $NB$ spin structures, exactly one of the three even $\beta$ loops fails this test and is zero.
	\item Finally, the empty diagram with $NN$ spin structure is zero. To show this, 
	we first create a topologically trivial circular $\beta$ loop. We then wrap it around the tube and fuse it 
	with itself to get the sum of two diagrams with parallel $\beta$ loops wrapping around the tube, one of 
	which has no fermion dots (the even channel of $\beta\tp \beta$) and one which has one dot on each $
	\beta$ loop (the odd fusion channel of $\beta\tp\beta$). 
	The diagram corresponding to the even fusion channel 
	is zero by observation 2 above, while the diagram with two odd loops is zero by an argument similar to observation 2: we slide one of the loops in the direction
	orthogonal to itself and pick up a Koszul sign, showing that the diagram must be zero.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{TorusBasisC2} shows the remaining non-zero diagrams for each spin structure.
It is easy to see that these diagrams are linearly independent if they are non-zero, but we have not yet proved that they are in fact non-zero.
To do this, we will employ a fancier argument relating a basis of the torus Hilbert space to minimal idempotents of the tube category.

Let $\tube^B$ denote the bounding tube category and $\tube^N$ denote the non-bounding tube category.
We can make use of the following results, which we prove in a more general context in Section \ref{torus_basis_theorem}:
The ground state spaces of the ${BB}, {NB},$ and ${BN}$ tori are purely even, with an orthogonal basis given by closed-up minimal idempotents of $\tube^B$.
Additionally, the ground state space of the $NN$ torus is isomorphic to $\cc^{p|q}$, where $p$ is the number of m-type idempotents of $\tube^N$
and $q$ is the number of q-type idempotents of $\tube^N$.
An orthogonal basis is given by (representatives of) the minimal m-type idempotents of $\tube^N$,
union $\{cl(\gamma_j)\}$,
where $\gamma_j$ runs through a set of representatives of odd endomorphisms of the minimal q-type idempotents of $\tube^N$.
We use $cl$ to denote the closure of an annular diagram on the torus.

For the $C_2$ theory, we have shown that $\tube^B$ has three m-type minimal idempotents, 
and $\tube^N$ has three q-type minimal idempotents.
Letting $\mch(T^2_{JK})$ denote the Hilbert space on the torus with $JK$ spin structure, 
it follows that $\mch(T^2_{BB}) \cong \mch(T^2_{NB}) \cong \mch(T^2_{BN}) \cong \cc^{3|0}$ and
$\mch(T^2_{NN}) \cong \cc^{0|3}$,
and so the diagrams of Figure \ref{TorusBasisC2} must indeed all be non-zero.

For future reference we also tabulate the change of basis between the ground-state tori in Figure \ref{TorusBasisC2} 
and the closed-up primitive idempotents.
To form string-net pictures drawn on tori from the idempotents, 
we close up the idempotents along the longitudinal direction by identifying the inner boundary 
of the annulus on which the idempotent lives with the outer boundary, 
specifying a choice of spin structure along the newly made cycle. 
We then express the result as a linear combination of the tori in Figure \ref{TorusBasisC2}.
For simplicity of notation, we will define 
\begin{align}
e=\; {\FubeXXXA} \quad h = \;{\FubesXsA}  \quad v =\; {\FubeXssA} \quad t = \; {\FubessXA}
\end{align}
and append subscripts to denote a particular spin structure. 
We will also use an overscript $\bullet$
if we are closing up an odd endomorphism rather than the idempotent itself.
For example,
\begin{align}
h_{NB}= \; \AddDatTorus{\FubesXsA}{N}{B} \quad \quad \text{and} \quad \quad \overset{\bullet}{t}_{NN} = \AddDatTorus{\FubessdXA}{N}{N} \; .

In this section, we will compute the representation of the modular $S$ and $T$ matrices in the $C_2$ theory, which together generate the modular groupoid. 
The modular $S$-matrix acts on states on the torus by interchanging the meridional and longitudinal cycles 
of the torus.
%\footnote{An alternate picture of the modular $S$-matrix in terms of Turaev-Viro state sums 
%is as follows: we note that there are two ways of representing a given string-net configuration on a torus embedded 
%in $S^3$ in terms of Turaev-Viro state-sums: one way is to fill the exterior of the torus with a 
%Turaev-Viro state-sum with boundary conditions specified by the given string-net configuration, as discussed in the previous section. 
%The other is to fill the {\it interior} of the torus with a Turaev-Viro state-sum possessing the same boundary conditions. 
%The modular $S$-matrix performs the change of basis between these two choices.
%We will avoid using this in what follows because it is difficult to perform explicit calculations along these lines.}. 
If we draw the torus as a square with opposite sides identified, then $S$ acts by rotating the square by $\pi/2$ clockwise. 
The modular $T$ matrix represents the action of the Dehn twist on the torus, 
which corresponds to cutting the torus along a meridional cycle, 
twisting the boundary conditions at the cut by $2\pi$ relative to one another, and gluing the torus back together.
In terms the annular pictures we have been drawing of the tubes, the twist is accomplished by 
twisting the inner boundary of the annulus by $2\pi$ counterclockwise relative to the outer boundary. 

\kw{Let's discuss this paragraph further on skype.}
Importantly, the $S$ and $T$ modular transformations do {\it not} always preserve the spin structure of the torus they act on. 
Figure \ref{spin_str_mapping_class_group} shows how the different possible spin structures are permuted under $S$ and $T$. 
Since $T$ does not preserve the spin structures, it cannot generically have well-defined eigenstates with a definite spin structure,
meaning that it will generically not be diagonal in the idempotent (quasiparticle) basis. 
\ethan{This means that the topological spins of quasiparticles, defined as their eigenvalues under $T$, will not always be strictly speaking well-defined, 
with their well-definedness depending on their associated spin structure.}
In contrast with $T$, the action of $T^2$ preserves spin structures, and so we are still able to associate 
definite $T^2$ 
eigenvalues to the quasiparticles in the theory.
\ethan{Putting aside the issue of spin structures, the twist of an idempotent (defined as the phase acquired when performing a $2\pi$ twist on the tubes in a given idempotent) 
is in general only defined 
up to a $\pm$ sign (which has been discussed in e.g. \cite{cano2014,bruillard2017,gu2014}).}
More precisely, the twist of a given simple object in the tube category is ambiguous across the isomorphism 
class of that object. 
Indeed, we will see that the twists of the two idempotents in the $m_\sigma$ isomorphism class (namely $m_\sigma^+$ and 
$m_\sigma^-$) have twists that differ by a factor of $-1$. 
\kw{I used to think that the above is true, but now I think that for the bounding annulus, the twist eigenvalue
does not make sense, even if we fix a representative in the equivalence class.
(Or at least there is a sense in which it does not make sense.)
For the non-bounding annulus, the twist is fine.
We should think more about this.}
\dave{
I think Ethan's been advocating this point.
I keep waffling. 
In our description they aren't gauge invariant so we shouldn't expect them to be physically observable.
We could define the twists on the representatives through $T e_i = \theta_i e_iT$.
This preserves the spin structure on either side and should be well defined.
}
\kw{Doesn't this force $\theta_i = \pm 1$?.
Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean by $T$.}


We now proceed to examine the action of the $S$ and $T$ modular transformations on the four spin tori which compose 
the 12-dimensional space listed in Figure \ref{TorusBasisC2}.
Although the calculations are most easily performed in the topological basis in Figure \ref{TorusBasisC2}, 
it is more natural to analyze the resulting transformations in the idempotent basis given in Table \ref{CTwoParticles}. 
As mentioned earlier, the basis vectors in the idempotent basis are constructed by taking the idempotents associated with the 
quasiparticles identified in the previous section and closing them up (with different choices of spin structure) 
along the longitudinal direction. 
The change of basis between the topological and idempotent bases are written explicitly in Figure \ref{C2Change_of_Basis}. 


We'll start with the $(B,B)$ spin structure, which is preserved under the action of $S$. 
In the topological basis $(e,v,h)^T$ we find
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
e\\
v\\
h\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BB} 
\xrightarrow{S^{BB \rightarrow BB}} & \left( \begin{matrix}
1&0&0\\
0&0&1\\
0&1&0\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
e\\
v\\
h\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BB}.
\end{align}
To transform $S^{BB\rightarrow BB}$ into the quasiparticle basis we use Figure \ref{C2Change_of_Basis}.
After the change of basis we find the familiar matrix
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
m_\unit\\
m_\sigma^+\\
m_\psi \\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BB} 
\xrightarrow{S^{BB \rightarrow BB}} &\frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{matrix}
1&d&1\\
d&0&-d\\
1&-d&1\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
m_\unit\\
m_\sigma^+\\
m_\psi \\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BB}
\end{align}
which is identical to the $S$-matrix for the Ising TQFT. 

Now for the $(B,N)$ and $(N,B)$ spin structures.
These are interchanged by the $S$-matrix, as indicated in Figure \ref{spin_str_mapping_class_group}.
In the idempotent bases these induce transformations between the non-vortex and vortex quasi-particles.
We obtain 
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
e\\
h\\
t\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BN} 
\xrightarrow{S^{BN \rightarrow NB}} & \left( \begin{matrix}
1&0&0\\
0&1&0\\
0&0&A^{10}\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
e\\
v\\
t\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NB}
\quad \text{and} \quad 
\left( \begin{matrix}
e\\
v\\
t\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NB} 
\xrightarrow{S^{NB \rightarrow BN}} & \left( \begin{matrix}
1&0&0\\
0&1&0\\
0&0&A^{6}\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
e\\
h\\
t\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BN}.
\end{align}
Notice that if we compose both transformations we get the identity. 
These can each be transformed into the idempotent bases using \eqref{C2Change_of_Basis}, 
where one finds,
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
m_\unit\\
m_\sigma^+\\
m_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BN} 
\xrightarrow{S^{BN \rightarrow NB}} &\frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{matrix}
1&d&1\\
-d&0&d\\ 
-1&d&-1\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
\hat{q}_\unit\\
\hat{q}_\sigma^+\\
\hat{q}_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NB}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
\hat{q}_\unit\\
\hat{q}_\sigma^+\\
\hat{q}_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NB} 
\xrightarrow{S^{NB \rightarrow BN}} & \frac{1}{2}\left( \begin{matrix}
1&-d&-1\\ 
d&0&d\\
1&d&-1\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
m_\unit\\
m_\sigma^+\\
m_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{BN}.
\end{align}
In order to make the matrix unitary, we have defined $\hat{q} = q/\sqrt{2}$ so that each $\hat{q}$ idempotent has unit norm.
\kw{Should add pointer to trace/IP section.}
To collect the results we've arrived at so far, we define
\begin{align}
{\bf M} = [ m_\unit \;  m_\sigma^+\;  m_\psi]^T \qquad \widehat{{\bf Q} }= [\hat{q}_\unit \; \hat{q}_\sigma \; \hat{q}_\psi ]^T
\end{align}
Then we have,
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
{\bf M}_{BN}\\
\widehat{{\bf Q} }_{NB}\\
{\bf M}_{BB}\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\xrightarrow{\;\; S \; \; } & \left( \begin{matrix}
&S^{BN \rightarrow NB}&\\
S^{NB \rightarrow BN}&&\\
&&S^{BB \rightarrow BB}\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
{\bf M}_{BN}\\
\widehat{{\bf Q} }_{NB}\\
{\bf M}_{BB}\\
\end{matrix} \right).
\end{align}

Similarly we can compute the modular $T$-matrix, the action of which twists the inner boundary of an annulus by an angle of $2\pi$ counterclockwise with respect to its outer boundary. 
This definition ensures that the $T$-matrix acts as the identity on tubes with no charge line 
(i.e. with no strings ending on their inner annular boundaries).
Within each spin structure sector the $T$-matrix is diagonal in the idempotent basis. 
%\dave{Should we define a complex number via $T e = \theta eT$ somewhere?
%And comment on the validity of calling it a twist.
%}
%\dave{I don't like this idea anymore.}
We can read off the structure of the $T$-matrix with the help of Figure \ref{spin_str_mapping_class_group} to find
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
{\bf M}_{BN}\\
\widehat{{\bf Q} }_{NB}\\
{\bf M}_{BB}\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\xrightarrow{\;\; T \; \; } & \left( \begin{matrix}
&&T^{BN \rightarrow BB}\\
&T^{NB \rightarrow NB}&\\
T^{BB \rightarrow BN}&&\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
{\bf M}_{BN}\\
\widehat{{\bf Q} }_{NB}\\
{\bf M}_{BB}\\
\end{matrix} \right).
\end{align}
With 
\begin{align}
T^{BN \rightarrow BB} =  & \left( \begin{matrix}
1&&\\
&A^3&\\
&&1\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\quad 
T^{NB \rightarrow NB}=  & \left( \begin{matrix}
A^5&&\\
&1&\\
&&-A^5\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\quad 
T^{BB \rightarrow BN}=  & \left( \begin{matrix}
1&&\\
&A^3&\\
&&1\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\end{align}
One can check that the usual modular group relation $(ST)^3 = \unit$ holds as expected. 


More interesting is the $(N,N)$ torus, whose spin structure is preserved under both $S$ and $T$. 
This has been investigated before in \cite{ware2016}, and our results agree with theirs in this case. 
According to Figure \ref{TorusBasisC2}, the Hilbert space is spanned by $\overset{\bullet}{h}$, $\overset{\bullet}{v}$, and $\overset{\bullet}{t}$,
where as before the $\bullet$ means that the associated tubes have odd fermion parity.
In the topological basis, we obtain
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
\overset{\bullet}{h}\\
\overset{\bullet}{v}\\
\overset{\bullet}{t}\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NN} 
\xrightarrow{S^{NN \rightarrow NN}} & \left( \begin{matrix}
0&1&0\\
 A^4&0&0\\
0&0&A^{10}\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
\overset{\bullet}{h}\\
\overset{\bullet}{v}\\
\overset{\bullet}{t}\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NN}
\end{align}
Now we need to transform into the idempotent (quasiparticle) basis. 
With the choice of basis in Figure \ref{C2Change_of_Basis} we find
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\unit\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\sigma\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NN} 
\xrightarrow{S^{NN \rightarrow NN}} &\frac{-A^2}{2} \left( \begin{matrix}
1& d&-1\\
d&0&d\\
-1& d&1\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\unit\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\sigma\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NN}.
\label{NNSmatrix}
\end{align}
Similarly, we can compute the modular $T$-matrix, 
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{matrix}
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\unit\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\sigma\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NN} 
\xrightarrow{T^{NN \rightarrow NN}} &\left( \begin{matrix}
A^5& &\\
&1&\\
&&-A^5\\
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\unit\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\sigma\\
\overset{\bullet}{q}_\psi\\
\end{matrix} \right)_{NN}
\end{align}
One can check that we have the modular relations
\begin{align}
 (S^{NN\ra NN}T^{NN\ra NN})^3 = (S^{NN \ra NN})^4= A^{8}\text{id} = -\text{id}
\end{align}
The minus sign comes from the fact that acting by $S^4$ or $(ST)^3$ performs a $2\pi$ rotation 
of the fermion framing, resulting in a phase of $-1$, since all states on the $(N,N)$ torus have odd fermion parity. 
For general theories, these relations become $(ST)^3=S^4=(-1)^F$, where $(-1)^F$ is the fermion 
parity operator. 
\kw{Add ref to other two examples below}
This also means that in the fermionic setting, 
the $S$-matrix is not self-dual as it is for bosonic theories.
\kw{What does ``self-dual" mean here?}


\medskip

Collecting these results, we can now write down the complete modular $S$ and $T$ matrices in the $C_2$ theory, 
which act across all spin structures. 
In the quasiparticle 
basis $[(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)_{BB},(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)_{BN},(q_\unit,q_\sigma,q_\psi)_{NB},(\overset{\bullet}{q}_\unit,\overset{\bullet}{q}_\sigma,\overset{\bullet}{q}_\psi)_{NN}]^T$, 
we have
\be \label{modularS}
S = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d & 1 &			&&&			&&&			&& \\ 
					      d & 0 &-d &			&&&			&&&			&&\\
					      1&-d&1 & 			&&&			&&&			&&\\
						&&&				&&&			1&d&1&		&& \\
						&&&				&&&			-d&0&d&		&&\\ 
						&&&				&&&			-1&d&-1&		&&\\
						&&&				1&-d&-1&		&&&			&&\\ 
						&&&				d&0&d&		&&&			&&\\
						&&&				1&d&-1&		&&&			&&\\ 
						&&&				&&&			&&&			-A^{2} & -A^{2}d & A^{2}\\
						&&&				&&&			&&&			-A^{2}d & 0 & -A^{2}d \\ 
						&&&				&&&			&&&			A^{2} & -A^{2}d & -A^{-2} \end{pmatrix}\ee		
%\kw{I think one of the -1's should be a +1 (does not agree with above in one of the middle blocks)}
%\dave{That's a good point. 
%It also doesn't match the matrices we found above (which I just double checked and seem to be correct).
%Ethan, call me on Skype when you have a chance. 
%I found the d's should have the other sign in the row and column you changed.}
%\ethan{Everything above should now be correct}
%\dave{I agree.}
where we have only listed the non-zero entries. 
$S$ has two different direct-sum decompositions. First, essentially by construction, 
it splits into a direct sum over blocks according to spin structures 
under the $S$ modular transformation. 
Additionally, we have $S = S_{even} \oplus S_{odd}$, where $S_{odd}$ is the $S$-matrix 
acting on ground states with odd fermion parity.
This decomposition is always possible, but it will not always match a decomposition based 
on spin structures. 
That is, while $S_{odd} = S^{NN\ra NN}$ in this theory, spin structure blocks of $S^{NN\ra NN}$ 
will not have a definite fermion parity in general; see Sections \ref{so36} and \ref{halfesix} for examples. 
Also note that $S^4 = \unit_{9\times9}\oplus(-\unit_{3\times3})$ in accordance with $S = S_{even} \oplus S_{odd}$ and $S^4=(-1)^F\unit$. 

Now for the $T$-matrix. 
In the same quasiparticle basis as before, the $T$-matrix is
\be 
T = \begin{pmatrix}   			&&&				1&0&0&		&&&			&& \\ 
					        &&&				0&A^3&0&	&&&			&&\\
					        &&& 				0&0&1&		&&&			&&\\
						1&0&0&			&&&			&&&			&& \\
						0&A^3&0&		&&&			&&&			&&\\
						0&0&1&			&&&			&&&			&&\\
						&&&				&&&			A^{5}&0&0&	&&\\
						&&&				&&&			0&1&0&		&&\\
						&&&				&&&			0&0&-A^{5}&	&&\\
						&&&				&&&			&&&			A^{5}&0&0\\
						&&&				&&&			&&&			0&1&0 \\ 
						&&&				&&&			&&&			0&0&-A^{5} \end{pmatrix}\ee	
The $T$-matrix is not completely diagonalized in the idempotent basis, since it acts nontrivially on the spin structures (although it is diagonalized within each spin structure block). 
%This leads to subtleties involved with identifying the topological twists of the quasiparticles, 
%which we elaborate on in the next section.

\subsection{Braiding data} \label{C2_braiding}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\kw{I think that there are (interesting and useful) subtleties when talking about braiding.
We must not only keep track of a spin structure on the pair of pants, but also keep track of 
the $\End(a)\times\End(b)\times\End(c)$ action on $V^{ab}_c$.
The latter amounts to keeping track of three independent spin framings on the three boundary
components, or in other words a relative spin structure.
I don't understand all of this as well as I would like, but I think that one
implication will be that we should treat braidings in a more sophisticated way than we do below.
If that's right, then we might want to move this section to a future paper that goes into more detail
about the subtleties.
}
\dave{That works for me.
Ethan, what do you think?}

In this section we compute the braiding data of the quasiparticles in the $C_2$ theory.
This in turn allows us to compute the mutual- and self-statistics of the quasiparticles in the theory.
In conventional (bosonic) topological phases, the matrix of double-braids (mutual statistics) 
is identical to the modular $S$-matrix and the matrix of topological twists (self-statistics) is identical to the 
modular $T$-matrix, which together form a representation of the modular group.  

The presence of spin structure considerations means that this correspondence does {\it not} 
hold in fermionic theories (indeed it cannot possibly hold in the $C_2$ theory because there are 6 quasiparticle excitations but 12 total ground states across all spin structures, meaning that the braiding matrices and the modular matrices must be of different dimension). 
However, the modular $S$ and $T$ matrices are still intimately related to the braiding data of the theory, and
can in fact be completely recovered from a complete knowledge of the braiding data.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{$R$-matrices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To begin, we will construct a table of the $R$ symbols in the theory. 
First, we need to set some conventions on our fusion spaces in this section, this is akin to picking a gauge for each fusion space. 
We will work on the pair of pants as described in Section \ref{C2_fusion_rules}.

We will write a generic even fusion space, which is an even vector in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$, as 
\begin{align} \label{pants_braiding_basis}
\CTwoFusion
\end{align}
where $a,b,c$ are idempotents (see Figure \ref{CTwoParticles}) and $u,v,w \in \{ \unit, \beta \}$ are variables indicating whether or not a $\beta$ line is present. 
The idempotent label at the crosses represent a collection of pictures, one for each tube in their definition, for example, 
\begin{align}
\overset{m_\sigma^+}{\IdempEnd} =  \frac{1}{2} \left( \tcca \; +   \; A^3 \tccb \right) \quad \text{and} \quad 
\underset{m_\sigma^+}{\text{\reflectbox{\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{$\IdempEnd$}}}} = \frac{1}{2} \left(  \tccc + A^3 \tccd \right).
\end{align}
\ethan{are these lines curling the right way? should their handedness be reversed?}
The termination of a $\beta$ line at the bottom of a line corresponds to a puncture surrounding the entire system.

We will calculate the braiding in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$ by moving the $a$ and $b$ punctures around one 
other and re-expressing the result in terms of the basis vectors in $V^{ba}_c$. 
When braiding q-type particles, we enforce their periodic boundary conditions graphically by introducing branch 
cuts ending on each q-type puncture, with the rule that dots sliding past a branch cut pick up a phase of $-1$. 
The branch cut records the difference between the spin structure inherited from the plane of the figure (the ``blackboard") and the
spin structure we want to depict.
For concreteness, we will draw our branch cuts to always extend from the puncture vertically to the point at $\infty$.
For example, to calculate $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$, we write
\kw{I don't understand subscript $\psi/1$.  Does it mean $\psi$-or-1?  If so, maybe it would be clearer to just pick 1 or $\psi$.}
\begin{align}
\qqmbraida \xrightarrow{\; \; R\;\; }\qqmbraidb \;=  \; \theta_{q_\psi}^* \qqmbraidc
\end{align}
where the dashed blue lines are the branch cuts, and we have taken advantage of our knowledge 
of the eigenvalue of $q_\psi$ under the twisted tube (i.e.\ the twist of $q_\psi$). 

We define odd vectors in $V^{a,b}_c$ by placing dots on the top left leg of the pants, on the 
leg marked $u$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. 
If this is impossible (e.g.\ if the top left leg is an $m_\psi$ idempotent), we put the dot on the top 
right leg of the pants, marked $v$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. 
For example, we can calculate the $R$-symbol $R^{m_\psi m_\sigma^+}_{m_\sigma^+} = -1$ by
\begin{align}
\mmmbraida \xrightarrow{\;\; R \; \;} \mmmbraidb \; = \; (-1)\mmmbraidc
\end{align}
A slightly more complicated example is the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$:
\begin{align}
\qqmbraidaOdd \xrightarrow{\;\; R \;\; } \qqmbraidbOdd \; = \; A^{4}\theta_{q_\psi}^* \qqmbraidcOdd
\end{align}
Note that we have assumed we can ``pivot'' branch cuts around the punctures on which they are located, 
provided that we pick up a factor of $-1$ each time the branch cut crosses a fermion. 

In accordance with the gauge choice we specified above, we have to remember to always move the dots 
back to the left side of the pants after the braid takes place, if possible. 
As an example, we can calculate the braiding of the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\sigma q_{1/\psi}}_{m_\sigma^+}$:
\begin{align}
\qqmbraidOdda\xrightarrow{\;\; R \; \;}  \qqmbraidOddb \; =\;

Manipulations like these can be used to work out the full table of $R$-symbols, which we present in Table \ref{Rtable}. 
The $\bullet$ symbol is used to denote odd fusion channels, i.e.\ the action of 
the braiding operation on an odd vector in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$.

\subsubsection{Twists and self-statistics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are three ways to compute the topological twist $\theta_a$ (self-statistics) of a quasiparticle $a$: by statistics (braiding two identical $a$ quasiparticles around one another), by twisting (applying Dehn twists on the tubes associated with $a$), and by modular transformations (by acting with the modular $T$-matrix on the ground states on the tori associated with $a$). 
We'll examine the first two methods below, and will comment on the relation between these and the third method at the end of the section. 

We'll start by computing the twists $\{\theta_a\}$ by statistics, namely by braiding two identical quasiparticles once around one another. 
This corresponds to tracing out the $R$ symbols \cite{barkeshli2014}:
\be \label{Tmattr} \theta_a = \frac{1}{d_a}\sum_b d_b \text{Tr}[R^{aa}_b],\ee
where the precise meaning of the trace is discussed in Section \ref{traces_and_innerproducts}.
Using Table \ref{Rtable}, we obtain
\be \theta_{m_\unit} = 1,\ \theta_{m_\psi} = 1,\ \theta_{m^\pm_\sigma} = \pm A^3\ee
for the non-vortex particles, and 
\be \theta_{q_\unit} = A^5,\ \theta_{q_\psi} = -A^5,\ \theta_{q_\sigma} = 1\ee
for the vortex particles. 

The twists can also be obtained by computing their twists, which is done by directly Dehn-twisting the tubes in question. 
This amounts to computing the eigenvalue of each quasiparticle under $t$, where $t$ is the twisted tube defined in \eqref{tube_shorthands}.
We can then use the tube algebra multiplication tables to read off the eigenvalues, and in the basis $(m_\unit,m^\pm_\sigma,m_\psi,q_\unit,q_\sigma,q_\psi)^T$ we find the matrix of self-statistics (which we will write as $\Tr\ R$ to distinguish it from the modular $T$-matrix, which is a $12\times 12$ non-diagonal matrix) to be
\be \Tr\ R = {\rm diag}[1,\pm A^3,1,A^{5},1,-A^{5}].\ee
This yields the same result as we obtained by tracing out the $R$-symbols (hence the notation), confirming that the spin-statistics relation holds in this theory.

Making an explicit choice for $A$ can help to shed some light on these results. For the choice $A = ie^{\pm i \pi/8}$ (giving $d=+\sqrt{2}$ and $A^4 = \pm i$), the $\Tr\ R$-matrix in the vortex sector (the $3\times3$ matrix of the twists of non-bounding idempotents) decomposes as the tensor product
\be \Tr\ R = T_{p\pm ip} \tp T_{\text{Ising}_{\nu =\mp1}},\ee
where $T_{p\pm ip} = e^{\pm i\pi/8}$ is the modular $T$-matrix of a $p\pm ip$ superconductor. 
This decomposition was noted in \cite{ware2016}, where the background physical fermions used to perform the condensation 
were identified with a $p\pm ip$ topological superconductor. 
This $p\pm ip$ superconductor has a chiral central charge of $c_-=1/2$, which precisely cancels 
out the chiral central charge of the Ising component in the tensor product, leaving a non-chiral theory---something
that is required since we have obtained the phase in question from a string-net lattice model. 


More generally, if we believe that the chiral central charge of these theories can be computed in the same 
way as in bosonic theories (as in \cite{cano2014}), then we must have $c_- =0$ independently 
for each spin structure sector, which is a nontrivial consistency check. We do not have $c_-=0$ in the 
non-vortex sector if we use the twists as written, but we have to keep in mind that the 
non-vortex twists possess a $\pm$ phase ambiguity. We then expect that in the 
expression for $c_-$ in the non-vortex sector, the sum over twists ``averages out'' and becomes zero, 
giving a non-chiral theory as required.

\subsubsection{Double braids and mutual statistics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Having obtained the $R$ symbols, we can also calculate the braiding data of the quasiparticles by calculating 
the double braids (mutual statistics) of the quasiparticles. 
As already mentioned, the matrix of double braids that contains information about the mutual statistics of quasiparticles is {\it distinct} from the modular $S$-matrix governing how the ground states on the torus transform under the $S$ modular transformation (indeed, they are not even of the same dimension!). 
To distinguish these two matrices, we will write the matrix of double braids between the 
quasiparticles in the theory as $\mcb^2$ (for the square of the braiding operator). 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{both_braided_tubes.pdf}
\caption{\label{braided_tubes} 
(a): How the tracing out of the $R$-symbols is performed when calculating the elements $[\mcb^2]_{ab}$ of the double braid matrix. 
Here, the $a$ and $b$ label tori hosting different quasiparticles, and are contained within a larger torus marked $c$. 
The entire network of tubes is embedded with the three-sphere, where it can then be evaluated to give a number (the partition function). 
(b): The setup for calculating the matrix $[\mcb^2_\psi]_{ab}$, which encapsulates odd braiding processes during which a fermion is exchanged (represented by the two connected blue dots) between the two particles being braided. }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

There are 
several ways to calculate $\mcb^2$. 
First, we will calculate $\mcb^2$ by tracing out the square of the $R$-symbols, using the formula \cite{Bonderson2007}
\be \label{Smattr} [\mcb^2]_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd}\sum_{c}d_c{\rm Tr}[R^{ab}_cR^{ba}_c],\ee
which continues to hold in the fermionic setting. 
Computing the trace with the aid of Table \ref{Rtable}, we find
\be \label{statistical_S}
 \mcb^2= \frac{1}{\mcd} \begin{pmatrix} 
1&\sqrt{2}&1&2\sqrt{2}&4&2\sqrt{2} \\
 \sqrt{2}&0&-\sqrt{2}&4&0&-4 \\ 
 1&-\sqrt{2}&1&-2\sqrt{2}&4&-2\sqrt{2} \\ 
 2\sqrt{2}&4& -2\sqrt{2}&0&0&0 \\ 
 4&0&4&0&0&0 \\ 
  2\sqrt{2}&-4&- 2\sqrt{2}&0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}. \ee
  
Let us now take a closer look at $\mcb^2$. 
The block of zeros in the bottom right warrants special attention, and means that braiding any two of the q-type particles around one another yields a state orthogonal to one in which they started. 
This is physically reasonable, since braiding a q-type particle through a q-type loop changes the q-loop's fermion parity, preventing it from fusing back to the vacuum. 
\dave{Should draw picture}
Indeed, this is the same reason why the matrix element $S_{\sigma\sigma}$ vanishes in the regular Ising theory. 

A more precise understanding for why the braiding between two q-type quasiparticles vanishes comes from considering the precise meaning of the trace in \eqref{Smattr}.
As described during our discussion of the ground states on the torus, the trace of an operator that acts on a collection of tubes (like the $\mcb^2$ matrix) is computed by identifying the top and bottom of the operator by ``closing up'' the tubes it contains along the time direction (see \eqref{TrO_def}).
The braiding of two quasiparticles $a$ and $b$ is then found by computing the partition function for the picture given in Figure \ref{braided_tubes} (a). 
In the figure, the two quasiparticles we are interested in braiding are hosted on the surface of the tori marked $a$ and $b$, which are contained inside a larger torus $c$, all of which are then embedded in $S^3$. 

In order for the diagram in the Figure \ref{braided_tubes} (a) to possess a self-consistent spin structure, we must place constraints on the spin structures of the tori $a,b,$ and $c$.
Let $t_m\in\zz_2$ and $t_l\in\zz_2$ denote the boundary conditions along tube $t$'s meridional (shorter, spacelike) and longitudinal (larger, timelike) cycles respectively, with $t_m,t_l=0$ corresponding to anti-periodic boundary conditions and $t_m,t_l=1$ corresponding to periodic boundary conditions.  
Then the existence of a consistent spin structure that may be extended into the ambient $S^3$ requires that 
\be a_m+b_m=c_m,\quad b_l+c_l=a_m,\quad a_l+c_l=b_m\ee
where all relations are understood to hold mod 2. 
Furthermore, if Figure \ref{TrO_def} defining the trace of an operator is to represent the trace (and not the supertrace), the torus $c$ must possess antiperiodic boundary conditions along it's longitudinal cycle. 
In particular, fixing $c_l=0$ (anti-periodic) forces 
\be a_m = b_l,\quad a_l=b_m.\ee
Therefore, if $a_m = b_m = 1$, which is the case if both $a$ and $b$ host q-type particles, then we must have $a_l = b_l = 1$. 
This explains why $[\mcb^2]_{ab}=0$ if both $a$ and $b$ are q-type: to trace out the $R$-symbols we need the $a$ and $b$ tori in Figure \ref{braided_tubes} (a) to each have $(N,N)$ spin structures. 
However, as we saw in the previous section on the modular $S$-matrix, non-zero string-net configurations on tori with $(N,N)$ spin structures must have {\it odd} fermion parity.
In calculating the $\mcb^2$-matrix we have assumed that each torus in Figure \ref{braided_tubes} has {\it even} fermion parity, and so $[\mcb^2]_{ab}$ must vanish if both $a$ and $b$ are q-type. 

The $\mcb^2$ matrix in \eqref{statistical_S} carries almost the same amount of information as the modular $S$-matrix worked out previously: we can identify each of its four $3\times3$ blocks with a $3\times3$ block in the modular $S$-matrix \eqref{modularS}. 
However, the bottom-right block in \eqref{modularS} proportional to $A^{-2}$ is missing. Does this mean that the braiding statistics capture less information than the modular transformations? 
In fact it does not, because there is an additional braiding process between q-type particles that we need to consider, one in which the quasiparticles being braided exchange a fermion (more generally, an odd number of fermions) during braiding. 
We will write the statistical matrix governing this braiding process as $\mcb^2_\psi$, and it is computed using the setup in Figure \ref{braided_tubes} (b), where the fermion exchanged between the two quasiparticles is indicated by the blue lines. 

We can account for the fermion exchange by adding additional dots to the tubes representing the quasiparticles being braided.
Mathematically, this means that $\mcb^2_\psi$ can be computed by tracing out the $R$-symbols composed with the operator $f_1\tp f_2$, which inserts fermions ordered in the appropriate way onto the $a$ and $b$ tubes as in Figure \ref{braided_tubes} (b). 
Thus, we have
\be [\mcb^2_\psi]_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd_{q}}\sum_cd_c{\rm Tr}[(f_1\tp f_2)R^{ab}_cR^{ba}_c], \ee
where 
\be \mcd^2_q = \sum_{a \text{\ q-type}}\frac{d_a^2}{\dim\End(a)}\ee
is the total quantum dimension of the q-type particles in the theory (this choice ensures that $\mcb^2_\psi$ is unitary). 
For the present case of the $C_2$ theory, $\mcd_q = 2$. 

We can compute the above formula by drawing the diagrams with the fermions $f_1$ and $f_2$ in place and then immediately using local relations to annihilate them into the vacuum.
For each fusion channel $c$ this leaves us with a diagram proportional to ${\rm Tr}(R^{ab}_cR^{ba}_c)$, which can be computed in the same way as the regular $\mcb^2$-matrix. 
Proceeding in this way, we obtain 
\be \mcb^2_\psi = \frac{A^{-2}}{2}\begin{pmatrix} -1 & d & 1 \\ d & 0 & d \\ 1 & d & -1\end{pmatrix},\ee
which matches the action of the modular $S$-matrix on tori with $(N,N)$ spin structures and satisfies $(\mcb^2_\psi)^4=(-1)^F\unit_{3\times3}=-\unit_{3\times3}$. 
Thus, the {\it full} statistical braiding information---both the $\mcb^2$ and $\mcb^2_\psi$ matrices---provide the same amount of information as the modular transformations on the collection of tori with each spin structure.

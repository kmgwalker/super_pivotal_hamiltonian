abstract="The state sum models in two dimensions introduced by Fukuma, Hosono and Kawai are generalised by allowing algebraic data from a non-symmetric Frobenius algebra. Without any further data, this leads to a state sum model on the sphere. When the data is augmented with a crossing map, the partition function is defined for any oriented surface with a spin structure. An algebraic condition that is necessary for the state sum model to be sensitive to spin structure is determined. Some examples of state sum models that distinguish topologically-inequivalent spin structures are calculated.",

abstract="We investigate the structure of the Longo--Rehren inclusion for a finite closed system of endomorphisms of factors, whose categorical structure is known to be the same as the asymptotic inclusion of A. Ocneanu. In particular, we obtain a precise description of the sectors associated with the Longo--Rehren inclusions in terms of half braidings, which do not necessarily satisfy the usual condition of braidings. In doing so, we give new proofs to most of the known statements concerning asymptotic inclusions. We construct a complete system of matrix units of the tube algebra using the half braidings, which will be used in the second part to describe concrete examples of the Longo--Rehren inclusions arising from the Cuntz algebra endomorphisms. We also discuss the case where the original system has a braiding, and generalize Ocneanu and Evans--Kawahigashi's method for the analysis of the asymptotic inclusions of the Hecke algebra subfactors.",

A is an algebra in the modular tensor category of Moore–Seiberg data of the underlying chiral CFT. The multiplication on A corresponds to the \{OPE\} of boundary fields for a single boundary condition. General boundary conditions are A-modules, and (generalised) defect lines are A–A-bimodules. The relation with three-dimensional \{TFT\} is used to express \{CFT\} data, like structure constants or torus and annulus coefficients, as invariants of links in three-manifolds. We compute explicitly the ordinary and twisted partition functions on the torus and the annulus partition functions. We prove that they satisfy consistency conditions, like modular invariance and NIM-rep properties. We suggest that our results can be interpreted in terms of non-commutative geometry over the modular tensor category of Moore–Seiberg data. "

abstract = "For a 3-manifold with triangulated boundary, the Turaev–Viro topological invariant can be interpreted as a quantum error-correcting code. The code has local stabilizers, identified by Levin and Wen, on a qudit lattice. Kitaev’s toric code arises as a special case. The toric code corresponds to an abelian anyon model, and therefore requires out-of-code operations to obtain universal quantum computation. In contrast, for many categories, such as the Fibonacci category, the Turaev–Viro code realizes a non-abelian anyon model. A universal set of fault-tolerant operations can be implemented by deforming the code with local gates, in order to implement anyon braiding. We identify the anyons in the code space, and present schemes for initialization, computation and measurement. This provides a family of constructions for fault-tolerant quantum computation that are closely related to topological quantum computation, but for which the fault tolerance is implemented in software rather than coming from a physical medium.

Log book for status of various sections of the paper.
Below is a copy of our table of contents. 
\dave{I figured below each section heading we can add notes saying what stage it is at.
e.g., finished, read with comments, etc.}

"**" = either KW has not had a close look, or there are to-do items beyond what are flagged in the 
comments (\kw \ethan \dave \nn).  If there are no ** below, then we can ignore this file and just deal with
the comments.

4.2.2 Quantum dimensions 
	** Dave will condense (ha ha)
	Aug 8 12:54PM - Dave merged this section with the previous one.  
	I added one paragraph to 4.2.1 computing the dimensions near the beginning of the examples for the trace formula,
	and one to the end showing dim(tube(c/psi)) =d_c d_c/psi if c =MTC.


old section 10 toc:

10 Super pivotal state sums and tensor networks
10.1 Notation, standardization, and Hilbert spaces 
10.2 Constructing the state sum 
10.3 The fermionic state sum 
10.4 The shadow world and ground state wavefunctions

Dave: 
- could add comment in Hamiltonian section about vortices carrying MZM's.
- Verlinde formula (157/158) split by table, maybe fix. Display at beginning of section?
- Comment on mor_{C/\psi}(a \to b \tp \psi) = mor_{C/\psi}(a \tp \psi \to b)?
Refer to Nayak, Freedman, Hasting via Majorana Dimer model \cite{Freedman2011a,Freedman2011b} \dave{Definitely need to cite Freedman2011a, maybe Freedman2011b as well. I haven't read that one.}

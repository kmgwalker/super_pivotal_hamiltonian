Log book for status of various sections of the paper.
Below is a copy of our table of contents. 
\dave{I figured below each section heading we can add notes saying what stage it is at.
e.g., finished, read with comments, etc.}

"**" = either KW has not had a close look, or there are to-do items beyond what are flagged in the 
comments (\kw \ethan \dave \nn).  If there are no ** below, then we can ignore this file and just deal with
the comments.

	Aug 8 12:54PM - Dave merged this section with the previous one.  
	I added one paragraph to 4.2.1 computing the dimensions near the beginning of the examples for the trace formula,
	and one to the end showing dim(tube(c/psi)) =d_c d_c/psi if c =MTC.

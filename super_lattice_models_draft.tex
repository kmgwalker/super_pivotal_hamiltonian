\section{Introduction}

- fermion condensation as a method to generate super-pivotal categories

- explain relations to previous work. 

- emphasize tensoring over endo-morphisms

-  mention string nets from tubes/excitations

\section{Fermion condensation in the Ising TQFT}

- Here we explain how to quotient by the fermion in the Ising TQFT. 

- condense fermions

- explain inconsistencies that necessitate spin structure, give physical interpretation of $p+ip$ SC.

- define spin structure and show why it's a phase of fermions. Mention that condensing $\psi$ couples the fermions and the Ising theory together 

- graphical calculus of condensed theory --- the constraint on $A^4$, how boxes work, moving dots around is $A^4$ from unitarity, etc

- give explicit example of why it's important to tensor over endomorphisms (e.g. getting endo space right)

- Drinfeld center of condensed theory: can briefly mention physical picture for why tubing (fubing?) works, talk about how this gets enlarged with spin stuff. Work through the identifications of each sector with the Clifford algebras 

- oddly isomorphic particles

- Fusion of quasi-particles --- include some (one or two?) examples of fusion spaces and how we do the calculation. 

- braiding of quasi-particles 

- modular transformations/relation to braiding data, filling in $S^3$, getting S matrix for all spin structures, philosophy about well-definedness of $S$ and $T$. 

- state sum???


\subsection{Ising TQFT}
Here we introduce the Ising TQFT via Kauffamann and Lins\cite{Lins1994}. We choose $A = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{16}}$, a primitive 16th root of unity. 
We label the identity particle $1$, Ising anyon $\sigma$ and the fermion $\psi$.
The quantum dimensions are
\be
d_1 = 1 \quad d_\sigma = -A^2 - A^{-2} \quad d_\psi =1 
\ee
The four different choices $A = \pm ie^{\pm i\pi/8}$ all give us positive quantum dimensions $d = \sqrt{2}$. 
\dave{will come back to this.}

for $C_2$. The first node in the $C_2$ Dynkin diagram is the (fermionic) vacuum, and the second node is $\beta$, the image of $\sigma$ under condensation.} 
\end{figure}


\subsection{Condensing $\psi$}
In this subsection we describe our procedure for performing fermion condensation in the Ising theory. While we are indeed condensing the fermionic $\psi$ particle in Ising, the term ``fermion condensation'' is a bit misleading, as what we will actually do is perform {\it boson} condensation of the bosonic bound state of the emergent fermion $\psi$ and an additional physical fermion. 

First, we notice that $\unit$ and $\psi$ form a fusion sub-algebra of the Ising fusion rules.
We would like to ``condense" the $\psi$ particle by modding out this sub-algebra.
Modding out by this sub-algebra is not straightforward though, as the $\psi$ particle is fermionic in both spin and statistics,
\begin{align} \label{psiafermion}
\Spin = (-1) \times  \PsiIdentity
\qquad \qquad \TwoPsiExchange =  (-1) \times\TwoPsiIdentity,
\end{align}
and therefore cannot be simply identified with the vacuum. 
%which means that it cannot be identified with the vacuum. Indeed, performing such an identification would result in a trivial theory \dave{Show picture.}

To remedy this, we will introduce a physical fermion field to the theory, which will provide a spin structure that compensates for the fermionic nature of the $\psi$ particle in the condensate. Readers unfamiliar with Spin structures and Pin structures are invited to read Appendix \ref{spins_and_pins}. Now we are ready to make use of spin structures to condense $\psi$. 
In our graphical calculus, condensing $\psi$ means that $\psi$ worldlines are allowed to have endpoints at locations where they ``disappear'' into the condensate. We will mark the locations where $\psi$ particles are absorbed into the condensate with boxes:
\begin{align}
\PsiFermion 
\end{align}
By itself this is inconsistent, since 
\be 
\PsiFermion = \PsiFermionTwist = (-1) \ \PsiFermion 
\ee
where we have made use of \eqref{psiafermion} in the second step. This inconsistency can be fixed if the box where $\psi$ is absorbed into the condensate is {\it fermionic}, which can be achieved by requiring the box to always be paired with a physical fermion. In this case, the composite of a terminal $\psi$ line and the fermionic box is a boson:
\begin{align}
\PsiFermion = (-1)\ \PsiFermionTwist = (-1)^2\ \PsiFermion 
\end{align}
where the first equality comes from the fact that twisting the physical fermion on the box by $2\pi$ gives a factor of $-1$.  and the rotated spin structure also picks up a minus sign. The boxes where the $\psi$ lines are absorbed into the condensate are also bosonic under exchange: 
\begin{align}
\TwoFermion = (-1)\ \TwoFermionExchange = (-1)^2\ \TwoFermion
\end{align}
where one minus sign comes from the exchange of the $\psi$ particles, and the other from the exchange of the physical fermions attached to the boxes. 

Although locally this $\psi$ termination point is a boson, it is not strictly a boson in the usual sense, as it still sees the spin structure: the $\psi$ fermions do not see the spin structure, but the physical fermion attached to the termination point does. This means that when the box is carried around a topologically non-trivial cycle it will pick up a factor of $\pm1$, depending on the ambient spin structure. 

A useful picture for this condensation process is to imagine the existence of a codimenion-1 ``back wall'' that plays the role of the condensate. In this picture, we interpret the boxes at the endpoints of $\psi$ lines as marking the location where $\psi$ lines meet the back wall. The back wall carries a spin structure to provide the minus signs that make equations \eqref{boxspin} and \eqref{boxbraid} hold. This point of view allows us to interpret the condensation procedure as a projection of the (2+1)D Ising TQFT to the (1+1)D $C_2$ theory. The fact that the Ising theory looses a dimension upon condensation is roughly equivalent to the statement that the Ising theory is a {\it braided} modular tensor category, but the $C_2$ theory is not\footnote{This is similar to the relationship between a (1+1)D phase described by the tensor category $\mcc$ and the (2+1)D phase described by the braided category $\mcz(\mcc)$.}
%This is because the spin structure ocurrs along on a two dimensional surface embedded in the TQFT. \ethan{I'm not sure how true this is}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics{BackWall.pdf}
      \caption{The ``back wall'' picture. Starting from a (2+1)D Ising TQFT (left), we allow $\psi$ worldlines to be absorbed into the back wall of the box, which is required to possess a spin structure in order for this absorption to be consistent. In the condensed theory, we replace the points where the $\psi$ lines meet the back wall with boxes, as in the right panel. This allows us to ``squash'' the box down to a two dimensional plane, allowing us to view the condensed theory as a (1+1)D theory. \dave{need to number things.}.}

\dave{Something about $\text{Pin}^{\pm}$ structures I never understood.}
One should be able to evaluate any pair of fermions terminating at the defect into a complex number.
In order to evaluate the picture into a number we require them to be in a standard form, and denote there evaluation by $\lambda$:
\begin{align}
\PsiEnd  = \lambda \times \text{(vaccuum)}
\label{EvalPsiPsi}
\end{align}
where $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. 
Reflection about the horizontal axis acts as an anti-linear operator\footnote{The fact that spatial reflections act as complex conjugation follows from the fact that Pin$^+(2)$ admits a real spinor representation.}, and so we have(\dave{may want to change this to about the vertical axis})
\begin{align}
\lambda^{*} = \left( \PsiEnd \right) ^{\dagger}  = \PsiEndExchange = - \lambda,
\label{phase}
\end{align}
implying that $\lambda = - \lambda^*$ and therefore $\lambda$ is purely imaginary number. 
It will depend on whether we choose a $\text{Pin}^{\pm}$ structure \dave{Need to understand these.}. \ethan{I can fill in pin stuff soon} 
We will see later on that consistency between $F$-moves and fermion removal requires that we choose $\lambda = A^4$, placing a nontrivial constraint on $A$. 

To summarize, we have seen that in order to condense an emergent fermion $\psi$ we must couple our theory to a spin structure, which is provided by a phase of free (physical) fermions $f$. Condensing the emergent fermions is then accomplished by coupling them to the spin structure, or equivalently by condensing $\psi f$ bound states. 

Note that we are using a {\it spin} structure to perform the condensation, and hence are assuming that the physical fermions $f$ that provide the spin structure are {\it uncharged} (i.e. they couple only to gravity). If the physical realization we have in mind for these fermions has $U(1)$ symmetry (as in a topological insulator), we would need to generalize to a spin$_c$ structure instead. However, if we are obtaining the physical fermions from a topological superconductor (we will see later that this is indeed what happens in the $C_2$ theory), then a spin structure is sufficient. 
 
\subsection{Isotopies of $C_2$}
%and so we can condense the $\psi$ particle by modding out this sub-algebra, provided that we introduce the spin structures needed to make this procedure legitimate. 
Now that we have worked out the graphical rules for the condensate we can check what implications it has on the Ising Fusion category.
We will denote this theory by $\cal{C}/\psi$ since we have enforced that the identity object in Ising to be isomorphic to $\psi$.
Many subtelties crop up when one does this. 
We have already seen that it necessitates a spin structure. 
Another subtelty is that multiplication of diagrams as to be modified, indeed we need to account for an equivalence relation arising from the isotopy of the fermionic objects. 
This is largest difference between a super fusion fusion category and a bosonic one.

We first observe that any diagram with a $\psi$ line can be absorbed into the condensate at the expense of a phase by using (\ref{EvalPsiPsi}).
Thus in the target theory the only objects remaining will be $\sigma$ lines with possible fermions attached. 
We will denote the image of $\sigma$ under the condensation procedure as $\beta$, and we will introduce a blue dot as a compact notation for a $\psi$ line that terminates on both $\beta$, and the spin structure. 
Diagrammatically any section of the $\beta$ line may look like
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \qquad \qquad \FubeXsds,
\end{align}
Indeed these are also the generators of the endorphisms of $\beta$.
Since we have one even generator and one odd generator we see that $\text{End}(\beta) \cong \mathbb{C}\ell_1$ \dave{Mention q-type here? Elsewhere? will decide as structure gets put together.}.
These odd endomorphisms already modify the tensor product of the theory, which we discuss below in Section \ref{IsingTensorProduct}


As shown in \ref{phase} the process of removing two fermions results in a phase:
\begin{align}
\SigmaDotDot\; = A^4\; \FubeXss
\end{align}
where we take $A^4 = i$ (although $A^4 = -i$ is also fine). 
Similarly, exchanging the ferimons fermions also results in a minus sign,
\begin{align}
\SigmaDotDot\;  &= - \; \SigmaDotDotExchange.
\end{align}
From the braiding endowed in the parent theory one ends up with some phases due to sliding the fermions past cups and caps in diagrams.
For example, we can compute,
\begin{align}
\DotSlidea =
\DotSlideb =
-A^4\DotSlidec =
-A^4\DotSlided 
\end{align}
Hence we have,
\begin{align} \label{dotslides}
\CapDotRight\; &= - A^4 \; \CapDotLeft & \CupDotRight\; &=  A^4 \; \CupDotLeft.
\end{align}
These phases can be derived completely from the {\it braiding data} of the Ising theory, and must be such that going around a circular $\beta$ loop gives a factor of $-1$, which enforces the constraint that $A^8 = -1$. In more general examples, the braiding data in the parent theory will not be such that this is the case, this precludes an ability to have q-type objects with $\cl_1$ endomorphism algebras. 

\dave{Add some pictures showing why these isotopies are compatible with the spin structure.}

\subsection{Tensor product in $\cal{C}/\psi$}
\label{IsingTensorProduct}
\ethan{I'm not sure if we should call this the $\tp$. I think we should maybe reserve $\tp$ for horizontal superposition as usual, and just call tube stacking tube algebra multiplication.}
The dots representing the points where $\psi$ lines end on $\beta$ lines can slide around on $\beta$ lines freely, provided that we keep track of the phase factors \eqref{dotslides} associated with passing them over caps and cups. 
This has non-trivial implications on the tensor products, indeed defining the tensor product of the squares above by stacking,
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes \FubeXsds = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} \sim \overset{\FubeXsds }{\FubeXss}
\label{Exampletp}
\end{align}
To the right, we have denoted an equivalent state using isotopy. 
If we are interested in pictures modulo local relations, we should define our tensor product so that it accounts for this equivalence relation. 
For example, naively tensoring over $\mathbb{C}$ can yield the following,
\begin{align}
V^{\beta 1}_\beta \tp_\mathbb{C} V^{\beta 1}_\beta = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss} \oplus \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} \oplus \overset{\FubeXsds}{\FubeXss} \oplus \overset{\FubeXsds_2}{\FubeXsds_1}
\end{align}
from which we naively conclude that the tensor product of the two vector spaces, each which has one even state and one odd state, results in a four dimensional vector space of two even state and two odd states. 
However, it's clear that not all the vectors appearing on the right hand side are linearly independant, indeed the middle two are related by isotopy, and so are the outer two. 
Hence we have to quotient out by isotopy. 

We will incorporate this equivalence relation into the tensor product of the super fusion category.
We are already used to modding out by a similar equivalence relation with the ordinary tensor product of a vector space of the complex numbers. 
Indeed, the analog of shuttling the dot past the junction is shuttling a complex number from one vector to another in a complex vector space we have 
\begin{align}
(\alpha \ket{x}) \tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{y} \sim \ket{x} \tp_\mathbb{C} (\alpha \ket{y}) \quad \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{C}
\end{align}
Similarly in a bosonic fusion category, our vectors are pictures, and the the tensor product glues those pictures together. 

In doing so we have to allow for arbitrary pictures  that matching the boundary conditions to be shuttled past the gluing junction. 
Shuttling a picture past the junction is just an endomorphism of the boundary condition. \dave{Include such abstract stuff? Also who to reference?}
Thus for gluing two pictures $P(Y_i)$ on surfaces $Y_i$  along a boundary $S \in \partial Y_i$ we have the natural extension to \dave{picture.}
\begin{align}
P_{(Y_1, S)} \tp_{\text{End}(S)}P_{(Y_2,S)} \equiv P_{(Y_1,S)} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} P_{(Y_2,S)} /\sim
\end{align}
where the equivalence relation $\sim$ is given by,
\begin{align}
 (P_{(Y_1,S)} \text{End}(S)) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} P_{(Y_2,S)}  \sim P_{(Y_1,S)} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (\text{End}(S) P_{(Y_2,S)}). 
\end{align}
This formulation of tensor products looks rather abstract, but at the same time familiar from the context of guage theories. 
It is useful to think of the tensoring over endomorphisms as ``integrating" over all gauge field configurations, consistent with the boundary conditions.

In this light, we will implement the ``guage" transformations with a series of isomorphims. 
At the end of the day it is a choice on whether we represent a quantum state by choosing one vector in the equivalence relation, or if we symmetrize over all possible states. 
Indeed, when writing down the string net Hamiltonian we will implement the symmetrization over all states by simply adding those terms to the Hamiltonian. 

Lets revisit the example in (\ref{Exampletp}). 
To tensor product over the endomorphisms of the boundary, which in this case is $\text{End}(\beta)$ we have \dave{obviously we have to clean this up.},
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta)} \FubeXsds  = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss}  / \sim \\
\text{where} 
 \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXss}  \sim  \overset{ \FubeXss }{\FubeXss} 
\end{align}
as anticipated.
We are also free to choose a single representative of this equivalence class which, for example
\begin{align}
\FubeXss \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta) }\FubeXsds = \overset{\FubeXss}{\FubeXsds} =  \FubeXsds \otimes_{\text{End}(\beta)}  \FubeXss
\end{align}
At this point, it may appear like we've introduced an unnecessary complication. 
The tensor product we originally looked at in (\ref{Exampletp}) ended up giving the right result. 
However, in the general theory it will be useful to explicitly write down a basis for these endomorphisms to make the pentagon equation explicit.

\subsection{F-symbols}
The F-symbols provide linear relations on diagrams.
Using the F-symbols from the original Ising theory, one can simply infer the linear relations on the diagrams in the condensed theory. 
To do this we first take a diagram in the Ising theory apply an F-move, then remove all $\psi$ lines through condensation. 
For example, we have,
\begin{align}
\TwoLine =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \CupCap +  \CupCapPsi \right) \quad \text{and} \quad \CupCapPsi \rightarrow A^{-4} \CupCapDots
\end{align}
using these relations we can infer both of the non-trivial F-moves of the condensed theory:
\begin{align}
\TwoLine\; & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \CupCap \; + \;A^{-4} \CupCapDots \right) \\
\CupCap \; &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\TwoLine \; + \; \TwoLineDots \right).
\end{align}
%These are all the linear relations on the diagrams that we get.

\ethan{commented out the discussion on tensoring over endos as it plays no role in the Ising theory and we probably shouldn't repeat what we'll be saying in section 6 regardless. Also, our choice for the F-moves (two in two out) is different from the one in the tensoring over endos discussion (one in four out) which makes talking about it here a bit unwieldy.}
\begin{comment}
By just doing the diagrammatics, we have avoided the subtlety of tensoring over the endomorphisms of $\beta$.
More formally, the F-symbol is a change of basis in the Hom space $V^{abc}_d$ \dave{explained in intro to Ising TQFT?}
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_d \rightarrow \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \tp_{\text{End}(y)} V^{cd}_y
\end{align}
It is useful to choose an explicit basis for the splitting spaces and use $F$-symbols which are purely complex subject to some constraints, i.e., they must commute with the ``gauage transformations". 
To that end, we pick a basis for the splitting spaces, and explicitly write down the matrices which induce the ``gauage" transformations. 

Hence we will consider all pictures in the ``extended" space $V^{ab}_x \tp_\mathbb{C} V^{xc}_d$, find all solutions to $F$-symbols subject to the constraint that they commute with the endomorphisms. 
Then we will project back into the ``physical" vector space $V^{ab}_x \tp_\text{End}(x) V^{xc}_d$ by symmetrizing over all the gauge transformations.

In the cases of interest, the generators of $\text{End}(x)$ are isomorphisms, lets choose a basis $f_i$ for these isomorphisms.
We wish to solve for 
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_d /\prod_i \langle V^{ab}_x f_i \tp V^{xc}_d \sim V^{ab}_x  \tp f_i V^{xc}_d  \rangle
\label{physicalspace}
\end{align}
Lets do this by introducing a set of matrices $M(f_i)$ defined via,
\begin{align}
M(f_i) V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_d = (V^{ab}_x f_i )\tp (f_i^{-1} V^{xc}_d).
\end{align}
Notice that the matrices $M(f_i)$ are always even. 
Hence as a representation they are always of type M.
They are also complex linear in the $f_i$: $M(\alpha f_i + \beta f_j) = \alpha M(f_i) + \beta M(f_j) $ for all $ \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$.
Hence the $M(f_i)$ form a finite dimensional matrix algebra, and the physical space in (\ref{physicalspace}) is just an irreducible representation of this matrix algebra. 

The equivalence relation is now simply given by any two vectors related by some complex linear combination of the $M(f_i)$. 
Hence for the $F$-symbol, we require the following diagram to be commutative, 
\begin{align}
	\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @R=30mm @C=42mm{
		 \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d \ar[d]^{M(f_x)}\ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}& \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y \ar[d]^{M(f_y)} \\
		\oplus_x V^{ab}_x \otimes V^{xc}_d  \ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}  & \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \otimes V^{bc}_y	
	}} \quad \text{i.e.,} \quad F^{abc}_d M(f_x) = M(f_y) F^{abc}_d
\end{align}
for all $f_x \in \text{End}(x)$ and $f_y \in \text{End}(y)$.
We will return to this in Section??? and describe in more detail.

\subsection{Quasiparticle excitations and the center of $C_2$} %\label{qps}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we identify the quasiparticle excitations in the $C_2$ theory. As was first shown in the mathematical literature by Occneanu [ref] and later demonstrated in the physics community by [lan wen, nick, yuting], the quasiparticle excitations in bosonic theories derived from a category $\mcc$ are given by the elements of the Drinfeld center $\mcz(\mcc)$, which can be obtained by finding the simple modules of an algebra known as the {\it tube algebra}. With appropriate modifications accounting for spin structure issues, this same construction holds in the more general fermionic setting considered here. Briefly, the tube algebra... \ethan{will finish later} \dave{We should figure out how the 'usual' definition of Drinfeld center is modified for super-fusion categories. }

For a review and a more detailed discussion of how the tube algebra works in the fermionic setting, we refer readers to Appendix \ref{tubeapp}. 



After applying local relations, the diagrams on any tube can be reduced to linear combinations the following diagrams:\begin{align}
\FubeXXX \quad \FubesXs    \quad \FubeXss \quad \FubessX   \quad \FubesdXs \quad  \FubeXsds \quad \FubessdX
\end{align}

The above tubes form a complete basis for the tube algebra in the bosonic case. In the fermionic case however, each tube comes equipped with a spin structure, given by an element $\eta \in H^1(C,\zt) \cong \zt$, where $C$ is the cylinder. \footnote{On manifolds $M$ like the cylinder or the torus, there is a canonical identification of spin structures with elements of $H^1(M,\zt)$; in more general cases spin structures on $M$ are merely an $H^1(M,\zt)$-torsor.} $\eta$ simply determines the nature of the boundary conditions for fermions traveling around the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder, and so the boundary conditions for tubes must obey a $\zt$ group structure. We have to be a little careful about making this identification, though: contractible fermionic loops that twist fermion ribbons by $2\pi$ are associated with a $-1$ sign, and so the identity element in $H^1(C,\zt)$ corresponds to {\it anti-periodic} (or non-vorex) boundary conditions, with the nontrivial element corresponding to periodic (or vortex) boundary conditions.

We will denote the spin structure of a given tube with a subscript, using $A$ for anti-periodic/non-vortex spin structure and $P$ for periodic/vortex spin structures. Interestingly, not every tube is consistent with each spin structure.
For example,
\begin{align}
\FubesdXs_A\;  = - \; \FubesdXs_A \implies \FubesdXs_A = 0,
\end{align}
where we have simply pulled the fermion around the non-contractible loop on the tube. A vortex tube with a horizontal $\beta$ line is also zero, since
\begin{align}
\FubesXs_P \; = \; (A^4)^*\; \FubesXsa_P \; = (A^4)^* \; \FubesXsb_P =\;  (A^4)^* \FubesXsc_P \; = - \FubesXs_P.
\end{align}
All other tubes are nonzero for both spin structures, and so a complete basis for tubes in the non-vortex sector is given by
\begin{align} \label{atubes}
\FubeXXX_A \quad \FubesXs_A \quad \FubeXss_A \quad \FubessX_A    \quad  \FubeXsds_A \quad \FubessdX_A
\end{align}
while a basis for the periodic sector is given by
\begin{align} \label{ptubes}
\FubeXXX_P\quad \FubeXss_P \quad \FubessX_P   \quad \FubesdXs_P \quad  \FubeXsds_P \quad \FubessdX_P.
\end{align}

The multiplication law in the tube algebra is given by stacking tubes on top of one another and simplifying the resulting tube using local relations.  
For example, in the periodic sector we have
\begin{align}
\FubesdXs_P \; \times \; \FubesdXs_P \; = \; \RDotTwoa_P \; = \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\RDotTwob_P + \RDotTwoc_P \right) = 2 \; \FubeXXX_P
\end{align}

Note that when we annihilate fermions into the vacuum to derive relations like this, we have to be careful about the order in which we do it, which is why we can never create two fermions side-by-side at the same time slice. For example, if we create fermion 1 above fermion 2 in a diagram, we must annihilate them along a $\Sigma$ string where fermion 1 is above fermion 2.
Also, note that since the spin structures on two tubes being fused must agree on the boundary at which they are being fused, periodic tubes only admit nonzero tensor products with periodic tubes, and similarly for anti-periodic tubes.

Relations like the ones above allow us to find the primitive central idempotents of the tube algebra, which carry the same information as the simple modules of the tube algebra, which in turn correspond to the irreducible vector spaces left invariant under the action of tube stacking. The simple modules are identified with quasiparticles, and so to find the quasiparticle spectrum of the theory, we simply need to find the irreducible spaces left invariant under action of the tube algebra. 
Since the tube algebra splits into a direct sum of tubes with different spin structures, its simple modules will split in a similar way. First, we turn to an analysis of tubes with non-vortex spin structure. 

\subsubsection{Non-vortex spin structure}

Let us first examine the subalgebra of tubes with no charge: that is, cylinders with empty boundary conditions on both their top and bottom. Writing this subalgebra as $\tube_0^A$, we see that it has two even generators:
\be \tube_0^A = \left\langle\; \FubeXXX_A,\; \FubesXs_A\;\right\rangle.\ee
Since $\tube_0^A$ has two even generators, as an algebra it must be isomorphic to $\cc^{2|0}$. The idempotents associated with this sector are easy to compute: $\cc^{2|0}$ has two simple modules and hence we obtain a pair of zero-charge quasiparticles, which we label by $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$. Explicitly, they are 
\be m_\unit = \frac{1}{2}\left( \FubeXXX_A +\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\FubesXs_A\right),\qquad m_\psi = \frac{1}{2} \left( \FubeXXX_A -\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \FubesXs_A\right).\ee
One can check that the action of the full tube algebra on both $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$ is simply scalar multiplication. 

Now we turn to the subalgebra $\tube^A_\beta$ of charged tubes: those whose top and bottom boundary conditions consist of a single marked $\beta$ point. There are two non-zero even tubes and two non-zero odd tubes,
\be \tube^A_\beta = \left\langle\; \FubeXss_A,\;\FubeXsds_A,\; \FubessX_A,\; \FubessdX_A\right\rangle,\ee
meaning that as an algebra, $\tube^A_\beta \cong \cc^{2|2}$. $\cc^{2|2}$ is isomorphic to both $\cl_2$ and $\cl_1\oplus \cl_1$, and so we know that this sector will contribute either one (if $\cl_2$) or two (if $\cl_1^{\oplus 2}$) quasiparticle excitations. 

To identify the simple modules of this subalgebra, we begin by writing down the multiplication rules. By using the local relations in the $C_2$ theory we can work out the multiplication table, which is presented in the following table. In the table, $A\times B$ means ``stack $A$ on top of $B$''. For multiplications involving odd tubes, we always take fermions in the $A$ tube to have a higher normal order than fermions in the $B$ tube.

\end{tabular}
%\caption{ \label{aptube_multtable} The multiplication table for the subalgebra $\tube_\beta^A$. \ethan{need to come back and write $A$s explicitly}}
\ee

Since the multiplication table for $\tube_\beta^A$ is non-abelian, as an algebra it must be $\cl_2$, as the other possibility (namely $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$) is abelian. 
In order to show that the previous table is indeed the multiplication table of $\cl_2$, we perform the following re-scaling:
\be \FubeXsds \mapsto e^{-\pi i/4} \FubeXsds,
\qquad \FubessX \mapsto e^{5\pi i/8} \FubessX,\qquad \FubessdX \mapsto e^{3\pi i/8} \FubessdX.\ee
With this, the re-scaled multiplication table becomes 
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\times$ in $\tube^A_{\beta} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\

$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\

$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ -\FubessdX  $&$ -\FubeXss $&$ \FubeXsds $\\
$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ -\FubessX $&$ -\FubeXsds $&$ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee
which is precisely the multiplication table of $\cl_2$. Indeed, recall that $\cl_2$ has two anticommuting odd generators $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ with $\gamma_1^2 = \gamma_2^2 = 1$, and two even generators, namely $1$ and $\gamma_1\gamma_2$. Therefore, we are led to make the identifications
\be 1 =\FubeXss,\quad \gamma_1 =  \FubeXsds,\quad \gamma_2 = \FubessdX,\quad i\gamma_1\gamma_2 =  \FubessX.\ee
We have the required anticommutation relations $\{\gamma_i,\gamma_j\} = 2\delta_{ij}$ and so indeed, $\tube^A_\beta \cong \cl_2$. We also note that the chirality operator in this setting is $\bar\gamma=i\gamma_1\gamma_2$ [cite Witten or Moore], which is just the two-dimensional analogue of the familiar four-dimensional chirality operator $\gamma_5=i\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_3$. Such an identification for $\bar\gamma$ makes perfect sense from the TQFT standpoint, since the operator $\bar\gamma=i\gamma_1\gamma_2$ implements the topological twist.  

We now turn to the task of identifying the quasiparticles (simple modules) of this subalgebra. 
At a high level, we can appeal to the Morita equivalence between $\cl_2$ and $\cc$ which states that $\cl_2$ and $\cc$ must have the same simple modules, implying that the subalgebra $\tube^A_\beta$ must correspond to only one type of quasiparticle\footnote{More generally, if $n$ is odd $\cl_n$ has a single irreducible representation (giving a single quasiparticle), while if $n$ is even $\cl_n$ always has a pair of oddly isomorphic irreducible representations differing by the sign of the representation of the chirality operator (also giving a single quasiparticle). }.

To see this more directly, we note that since $\cl_2 \cong \End(\cc^{1|1})$, its simple modules (quasiparticles) can each be identified with the space $\cc^{1|1}$. It's easy to check that there are two different simple modules corresponding to this space, which we will write as $m^{\pm}_\sigma$. These simple modules correspond to the representations $\rho^\pm : \cl_2 \ra \Aut(\cc^{1|1})$ given by $\rho^\pm(1) = \sigma^0,\rho^\pm(\gamma_1) = \sigma^y,$ and $\rho^\pm(\gamma_2) = \pm \sigma^x$, where the $\gamma_i$ maintain their earlier identifications. We see that the difference between these two representations is the sign of the representation of the chirality operator $\bar\gamma = \pm \sigma^z $, and as such these representations form a left- and right-handed opposite-chirality pair. 
Since simple modules are associated with quasiparticles, this naively produces a pair of quasiparticles. Since the two representations differ in the sign of the representation matrix of the chirality operator $\bar\gamma$, we may write them explicitly as 
\be m_\sigma^\pm = \frac{1}{2} \left(\FubeXss_A \pm e^{i\pi/8}\ \FubessX_A\right).\ee
%Note that we're letting each fube in the above expression represent its isomorphism class, which is why we haven't added any fubes in $\fld(C)^1$ with odd fermion parity to the expression for $m_\sigma^\pm$ (as they are isomorphic to the even-parity fubes in the expression for $m^\pm$) . 

This looks to give us two quasiparticles, which seems to be in contradiction to our argument involving Morita equivalence. The resolution to this apparent contradiction is that the two simple modules $m^\pm_\sigma$ are actually {\it oddly isomorphic} to one another, by virtue of the anti-periodic spin structures they possess. Indeed, creating a fermion on the top of the $\gamma_2$ tube (which corresponds to the isomorphism given by left multiplication by $\gamma_1$), dragging it around the $\gamma_2$ tube to the bottom, and then annihilating it (through the isomorphism given by right multiplication by $\gamma_1$) acts on the matrix representations as $\rho^\pm(\gamma_2) \mapsto \rho^\mp(\gamma_2)$, and thus establishes an isomorphism $m^+_\sigma\cong m^-_\sigma$\footnote{This odd isomorphism follows from the exact sequence $0\ra \spin(n) \ra \pin^\pm(n) \ra \zt \ra 0$, which gives an automorphism on $\spin(n)$ that sends $v \mapsto \gamma_i v \gamma_i$ for $\gamma_i \in \pin^\pm(n)$.}. As an equation, this reads 
\be \gamma_1 m_\sigma^\pm \gamma_1 = m_\sigma^\mp.\ee

Since only isomorphism classes of quasiparticles are physical, we can therefore identify the two modules $m_\sigma^\pm$ with a single quasiparticle. When doing calculations it is often helpful to fix a particular representative of the $m_\sigma^\pm$ isomorphism class, which we will choose to be $m_\sigma^+$. 

We will examine the fusion rules and braiding properties of the three quasiparticles identified so far later in Sections \ref{fusion} and \ref{braiding}. For now, we repeat our quasiparticle identification procedure for quasiparticles in the vortex sector, which possess spin structures with periodic boundary conditions around the cylinder. 

\subsubsection{Vortex spin structure}

As in the last section, we first examine the subalgebra $\tube^P_0$, consisting of tubes with no charge and with periodic boundary conditions. This algebra is two dimensional, generated by a single even vector and a single odd vector: 
\be \tube^P_0 = \left\langle \FubeXXX_P,\; \FubesdXs_P\right\rangle.\ee
As an algebra then, it must be isomorphic to $\cl_1$. 
$\cl_1$ has only one simple module, namely $\cc^{1|1}$ with the matrix representation $\rho(1) = \sigma^0,\rho(\gamma)=\sigma^x$. Therefore, this subalgebra will support only one quasiparticle. Since idempotents must always be even, the explicit presentation of this quasiparticle is simply the empty tube. We will denote this quasiparticle by $q_\sigma$:
%The explicit presentation for the $\cl_1$ quasiparticle is a bit more subtle. Since $\fld^P(C)$ is a graded superspace, we are prevented from adding field configurations with different fermion parity, and thus cannot form superpositions of the tubes in $\fube^P_0$. However, we note that in $\cl_1$, $1$ and $\gamma$ are isomorphic through multiplication by $\gamma$, which establishes an (odd) isomorphism between the two basis vectors in $\fube^P_0$. Since only isomorphism classes of field configurations are physical, we can identify the two fubes with one another, which form an orbit under multiplication by $\gamma$. For definiteness we will choose to represent this isomorphism class by the even-parity sector, and so we write the $\cl_1$ quasiparticle as (really? or just say idempotents have to be even?)
\be q_\sigma = \FubeXXX_P.\ee

Now we examine the charge sector, corresponding to the subalgebra $\fube_\beta^P$ of vortex tubes with nontrivial charge. This subalgebra again has two even generators and two odd generators:
\be \tube^P_\beta = \left\langle\; \FubeXss_P,\;\FubeXsds_P,\; \FubessX_P,\; \FubessdX_P\right\rangle.\ee
Therefore, as an algebra, we must have $\tube_\beta^P \cong \cl_2$ or $\tube_\beta^P \cong \cl_1\oplus\cl_1$. To determine which choice is correct, we work out the multiplication table, which is
\be
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c r}
$\tp$ in $\fube^P_{\Sigma} $          & $\FubeXss $ & $\FubeXsds $ & $\FubessX $&$ \FubessdX$  \\
\hline

$\FubeXss$ & $\FubeXss$ & $ \FubeXsds$  & $\FubessX$ & $\FubessdX$  \\

$\FubeXsds$           & $\FubeXsds $& $i\ \FubeXss$ & $\FubessdX $& $i\ \FubessX  $\\

$\FubessX$          & $\FubessX $&$ \ \FubessdX  $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXss $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $\\

$\FubessdX    $&$ \FubessdX $&$ i\ \FubessX $&$ e^{i\pi/4}\ \FubeXsds $&$ e^{i3\pi/4}\ \FubeXss$   \\
\end{tabular}
\ee
Since the multiplication table is abelian, we must have $\tube_\beta^P \cong \cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ (as the other choice, $\cl_2$, is non-abelian). 
%To see this explicitly, we perform the re-scaling \ethan{not sure if this is really necessary} 
%\be \FubeXsds \mapsto e^{-\pi i/4} \FubeXsds,
%\qquad \FubessX \mapsto e^{\pi i/8} \FubessX,\qquad \FubessdX \mapsto e^{-\pi i/8} \FubessdX.\ee
%With this choice of re-scaling, the re-scaled multiplication table is the same as re-scaled one for $\fube_\Sigma^A$, expect there are no minus signs, meaning that $\fube_\Sigma^P$ is commutative. Since we argued earlier that the only choices for $\fube_\Sigma^{A/P}$ were $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ or $\cl_2$, commutativity implies that we can set $\fube_\Sigma^P \cong \cl_1\oplus\cl_1$. To check this we need to do a little manipulation, since the multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$ doesn't look like a direct sum of two $\cl_1$ multiplication tables at first glance. To fix notation, we will write the two odd generators in $\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ as $\gamma^+$ and $\gamma^-$, and the even generators as $1^+, 1^-$. If we define these generators in terms of the fubes by (keeping the phases explicit)
To see this explicitly, we make the identifications
\be \unit^\pm = \frac{1}{2}\left(\FubeXss \pm e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessX\right),\qquad   \gamma^\pm = \frac{e^{-i\pi/4}}{2}\left(\FubeXsds \pm e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessdX\right).\ee
If we then re-write the multiplication table for $\fube_\Sigma^P$, we see that we indeed get a $\langle \unit^+ ,\gamma^+\rangle \oplus \langle \unit^- \oplus \gamma^-\rangle =\cl_1\oplus\cl_1$ structure with $(\gamma^\pm)^2 = \unit^\pm$. Thus, the $\fube_\Sigma^P$ subalgebra gives rise to two $\cl_1$-type quasiparticles, corresponding to the even simple modules $\unit^\pm$. We will denote these two quasiparticles as $q_\unit$ and $q_\psi$.

To summarize, we have found six types of quasiparticles in the theory: three vortex quasiparticles associated with tubes possessing periodic spin structures, and three non-vortex quasiparticles associated with tubes possessing anti-periodic boundary spin structures. The three non-vortex quasiparticles are 
\be \ba & m_\unit = \frac{1}{2} \left( \FubeXXX_A  +\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\FubesXs_A\right),\ m_\psi = \frac{1}{2} \left( \FubeXXX_A - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \FubesXs_A\right),\\ & m_\sigma^\pm = \frac{1}{2} \left(\FubeXss_A \pm e^{i\pi/8}\ \FubessX_A\right),\ea\ee
while the three vortex quasiparticles are 
\be q_\unit = \frac{1}{2}\left(\FubeXss + e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessX\right),\ q_\psi = \frac{1}{2}\left(\FubeXss - e^{-i\pi/8}\FubessX\right),\ q_\sigma = \FubeXXX.\ee

Before moving on, we note that we could have obtained a large amount of information about the quasiparticle content of the theory without actually finding the explicit representations of the simple modules of the tube algebra. The idea is to exploit the sum-of-squares formula, relating the dimension of an algebra to the dimensions of its simple modules. In the bosonic case, the formula is as follows: if $\{M_a\}$ is a list of the simple modules of the tube algebra, then 
\be \dim \tube = \sum_a (\dim M_a)^2.\ee
In the fermionic case, this is modified slightly to account for the fact that the endomorphism algebras of these modules may be $\cl_1$ instead of $\cc$. The correct modification is
\be \label{sumofsqs} \dim \tube = \sum_{a | \End(a) \cong \cc} (\dim M_a)^2 + 2\sum_{a|\End(a) \cong \cl_1} (\dim M_a)^2.\ee
This formula actually allows us to exactly reproduce the quasiparticle content of the $C_2$ theory starting with equations \eqref{atubes} and \eqref{ptubes} enumerating the elements of the tube algebra. Since \eqref{sumofsqs} holds for any algebra, it holds for the subalgebras $\tube^P$ and $\tube^A$. Since taking fermions around tubes with periodic spin structures acts as the identity,\footnote{This is true in the $C_2$ theory, but not in general; see Sec \ref{e6} for a counterexample.} all of the quasiparticles associated with periodic spin structures will have $\cl_1$ endomorphism algebras (that is, they will all be q-type). Furthermore, since $\dim \tube^A = \dim \tube^P = 6$, we have 
\be 6 = \sum_{a \in \mcz^A(C_2)} (\dim M_a)^2,\qquad 6 = 2 \sum_{a\in \mcz^P(C_2)} (\dim M_a)^2,\ee
where $\mcz^A(C_2)$ are all the quasiparticles associated with anti-periodic spin structures and $\mcz^P(C_2)$ are those associated with periodic spin structures. This immediately tells us that the periodic sector must contain three quasiparticles, while the anti-periodic sector must contain either six $(6 = 6\cdot 1^2)$ or three $(6=2\cdot 1^2 + 2^2)$ quasiparticles. However, since $\tube^A$ is non-abelian the former possibility is ruled out, and thus we have determined that $\mcz(C_2)$ must contain six quasiparticles, with three associated to each spin structure. 


\subsection{Obtaining the quasiparticle fusion rules} \label{fusion}

With all quasiparticles in hand, we are ready to compute their fusion rules.

 
 To determine whether the quasiparticle $c$ is the fusion product $a\tp b$, we ask if there exists a linear combination of pairs of pants that will take two of the idempotents to the third. The dimension of this space is the fusion multiplicity. 

Computationally it is easier to search for pairs of pants that are invariant under application of each idempotent. 
For example, suppose we wanted to find the fusion rule for $q_\sigma \otimes m_1$.
We first note that the spin structure boundary conditions require that they fuse to a vortex (a fube with a periodic spin structure). Furthurmore, since both $m_1$ and $q_\sigma$ have flux and no charge, we know that the pants cannot have any charge lines. Since there is only one resulting fube that has no charge lines and periodic  boundary conditions, namely $q_\sigma$, we know that the pair of pants desribing the fusion $q_\sigma \otimes m_1$ is the supervector space with even generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_1}^{q_\sigma}(Y; \text{even}) = \left\langle \PantsPAP \; +\;  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
and odd generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_1}^{q_\sigma}(Y;  \text{odd}) = \left\langle \PantsPsdAP \; +\;  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPsdAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
\dave{add note about moving dot from top leg to bottom.}
and the fusion rule is $q_\sigma \otimes m_1 = q_\sigma$.
Similarly the supervector space $\fld_{q_\sigma \tp m_\psi}(Y)$ has one even generator
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp m_\psi}(Y) = \left\langle \PantsPAP \; - \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPAsP \right \rangle
\end{align}
and the analgous odd generator
and therefore $q_\sigma \tp m_\psi = q_\sigma$.
\dave{Fix to include odd generators as well in rest of section.}
A more nontrivial example is to consider the tensor product of two $q_\sigma$ idempotents.
This again has no charge, but the resulting tube can have either flux, 
\begin{align}
\fld_{q_\sigma\tp q_\sigma}(Y) &= \left\langle \PantsPPA \; +\;  \PantsPPAs \right \rangle\\
&= \left\langle \PantsPPA  + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAs \right \rangle \bigoplus \left\langle \PantsPPA  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsPPAs \right \rangle
\end{align}
where in the second line we have decomposed the first line into pants that are invariant under application of $m_1$ and $m_\psi$. 
This demonstrates the fusion rule $q_\sigma \tp q_\sigma = m_1 \oplus m_\psi$. 
Slightly more non-trivial fusion rules follows from $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi$ and $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi$. 
The idempotent $m_\psi$ is purely flux, and so the pants can only have pure flux degrees of freedom on the leg matching the $m_\psi$ idempotent. $m_\sigma^{\pm}$ also has charge. 
Hence the idempotent resulting from from fusion will also have charge and again have anti periodic boundary conditions.
One finds that the $m_\sigma$ idempotent can be slipped up the pair of pants with the expense of introducing a $\sigma$ line around the other leg,
\begin{align}
\PantsAstAAs  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \;  \PantsAsAshAsvt
\end{align}
Now one can check that $m_\psi$ is an eigenstate of the closed sigma loop with eigenvalue $-\sqrt{2}$ and $m_1$ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue $+\sqrt{2}$. Hence one finds that $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi  = m_\sigma^{\mp} \cong m_\sigma^\pm$ and $m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_1 = m_\sigma^{\pm}$. 
Hence we can write, for example,
\begin{align}
\fld_{m_\sigma^{\pm} \tp m_\psi}^{m_\sigma^{\mp}}(Y) = \left\langle \PantsAsAAs -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\PantsAsAshAs \pm \PantsAstAAs  \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \PantsAstAshAs   \right \rangle
\end{align}
Since the $m_\sigma^{+}$ is isomorphic to to $m_\sigma^-$ we can always choose to work with either $m_\sigma^+$ or $m_\sigma^-$. In this case we can write,
\begin{align}
\fld_{m_\sigma^{+} \tp m_\psi}^{m_\sigma^{+}}({}^AY_A^A, \text{odd}) = \left\langle \PantssvXsvd -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Pantssvtshsvd + \PantssvtXsvd  - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Pantssvshsvd   \right \rangle 
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Braiding data} \label{braiding}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{$R$-matrices}
In this subsection we provide a table of the $R$ symbols in the theory. First, we need to set some conventions on our fusion spaces. We will work on the three-punctured sphere rather than drawing out pairs of pants, as it is much easier to perform calculations using the three-punctured sphere picture. 

We will write a generic even fusion space, which is an even vector in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$, as 
\be \label{pants_braiding_basis} \includegraphics{pants_braiding_basis.pdf},\ee
where $a,b,c\in \mcz(C_2)$ and $u,v,w\in \zt$ are variables indicating whether or not a $\beta$ line is present on the given link. The idempotent labels represent a collection of pictures, one for each tube in their definition. For example, 
\be \includegraphics{msig_def.pdf} \ee

We will calculate the braiding in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$ by moving the $a$ and $b$ punctures around one other and re-expressing the result in terms of the basis vectors in $V^{ba}_c$. When braiding q-type particles, we enforce their periodic boundary conditions graphically by introducing branch cuts ending on each q-type puncture, with the rule that dots sliding past a branch cut pick up a phase of $-1$. For concreteness, we will draw our branch cuts to always meet near the center of the three punctures. For example, to calculate $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$, we write
\be \includegraphics{qpsiq1psi_braiding} \ee
where the dashed blue lines are the branch cuts, and we have taken advantage of our knowledge of the eigenvalue of $q_\psi$ under the twisted tube (i.e. the spin of $q_\psi$). 

We define odd vectors in $V^{a,b}_c$ by placing dots on the top left leg of the pants, on the leg marked $u$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. If this is impossible (e.g. if the top left leg is an $m_\psi$ idempotent), we put the dot on the top right leg of the pants, marked $v$ in \eqref{pants_braiding_basis}. For example, we can calculate the $R$-symbol $R^{m_\psi m_\sigma^+}_{m_\sigma^+} = -1$ by
\be \includegraphics{mpsimsig_braiding.pdf}.\ee
A slightly more complicated example is the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\psi q_{1/\psi}}_{m_{\psi/1}}$:
\be \includegraphics{qpsiq1psidot_braiding.pdf} \ee
Note that we have assumed we can ``pivot'' branch cuts around the punctures on which they are located, provided that we pick up a factor of $-1$ each time the branch cut crosses a fermion. 

We have to remember to always move the dots back to the left side of the pants after the braid takes place, if possible. As an example, we can calculate the braiding of the odd fusion channel in $R^{q_\sigma q_{1/\psi}}_{m_\sigma^+}$:
\be \includegraphics{qsigq1psidot_braiding.pdf} \ee


Manipulations like these can be used to work out the full table of $R$-symbols, which we present in Table \ref{Rtable}. The $\bullet$ symbol is used to denote odd fusion channels, i.e. the action of the braiding operation on an odd vector in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$.

\caption{\label{Rtable} The R-symbols for the $C_2$ theory. The particle labels in each entry denote fusion channels, with the bullets signifying which fusion channels are odd.

If we switched the choice for $A^4$ (e.g. from $i$ to $-i$), we could obtain the switched $R$-symbols by sending $\zeta \mapsto \zeta^*$. 

\subsection{Exchange statistics}

\subsubsection{Twists and the $T$ matrix}
There are three ways to compute the twist: by statistics (braiding two identical idempotents around one another), by spin (applying Dehn twists on the idempotents), and by modular transformations (by performing Dehn twists on the torus). 

We'll start by computing the twists by statistics, namely by tracing out the $R$ symbols:
\be \theta_a = \frac{1}{d_a}\sum_b d_b \text{Tr}[R^{aa}_b].\ee
Using Table \ref{Rtable}, we obtain
\be \theta_{m_\unit} = 1,\ \theta_{m_\psi} = 1,\ \theta_{m^\pm_\sigma} = \pm e^{-i\pi/8}\ee
for the non-vortex particles, and 
\be \theta_{q_\unit} = e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\psi} = -e^{i\pi/8},\ \theta_{q_\sigma} = 1\ee
for the vortex particles. The twists can also be obtained by directly Dehn-twisting the tubes in question. This yields the same result, implying that the spin-statistics relation holds in this theory. \ethan{again, will have to come back and write stuff in terms of $A$}

Note that the $T$-matrix in the vortex sector decomposes as 
\be T_P = T_{p+ip} \tp T_{\text{Ising}_{\nu =-1}},\ee
where $T_{p+ip} = e^{i\pi/8}$. 
hinting at the existence of a secret $p+ip$ superconductor in the vortex sector. We will have more to say about this later when we discuss modular transformations on the torus. \ethan{for $A^4=-i$, this is a stack of a $p-ip$ superconductor and a $\nu = 1$ Ising instead}

In the expressions above, the twists of every non-vortex particle are ambiguous up to a factor of $\pm1$, corresponding to an ambiguity in the parity of physical fermions attached to the tubes at the time of twisting. The vortex particles have no such ambiguity, since moving a physical fermion around a tube with periodic boundary conditions picks up no $-1$ signs.   

We now briefly comment on the issue of the chiral central charge of this theory. Since we have realized this theory as a lattice model, we expect that it possesses chiral central charge $c_- = 0$. 
If we believe that the chiral central charge of these theories can be computed in the same way as in bosonic theories, then we see that we indeed have $c_- =0$ for the vortex sector, which is a nontrivial consistency check. We do not have $c_-=0$ in the non-vortex sector if we use the twists as written, but we have to keep in mind that the non-vortex twists possess a $\pm$ phase ambiguity. We then expect that in the expression for $c_-$ in the non-vortex sector, the sum over twists ``averages out'' and becomes zero. 

\subsubsection{Topological $S$-matrix}

Having obtained the $R$ symbols, we can also calculate the mutual statistics of the quasiparticles, which is encapsulated by the $S$-matrix. Unlike in bosonic theories, the $S$-matrix that contains information about the mutual statistics of quasiparticles is {\it distinct} from the $S$-matrix that characterizes how the ground states on the torus transform under the modular transformation $z\mapsto 1/z$. This distinction is because of the need to choose a spin structure on the torus: we will return to this issue in Section \ref{modulartforms}. For now, we will restrict ourselves to calculating the $S$-matrix measuring the mutual statistics of the quasiparticles in the theory. 

To do this, we will need to know the quantum dimensions of the quasiparticles. They are
\be d_{m_1} = d_{m_\psi} = 1,\quad d_{m_\sigma^+} = d_{q_1} = d_{q_\psi} = \sqrt{2},\quad d_{q_\sigma} = 2,\ee
which gives $\mcd = \sqrt{\sum_{a\in \mcz(C_2)} d_a^2} = \sqrt{12}$. 

There are several ways to calculate $S$. For all of them, we should keep in mind that although there are some $\pm1$ ambiguities in the $T$-matrix, there should be no ambiguities present in $S$, since physical fermions have trivial double-braiding with one another. That is, mapping $m_a \mapsto fm_a$ where $a\in \{\unit,\psi,\sigma\}$ and $f$ is a physical fermion should not affect the answer we get for the $S$-matrix.

First, we can calculate $S$ by tracing out the $R$-symbols, using the formula
\be S_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd}\sum_{c}d_c{\rm Tr}[R^{ab}_cR^{ba}_c],\ee
which continues to hold in the fermionic setting. Computing this with the aid of Table \ref{Rtable}, we find
\be 
 S= \frac{1}{\mcd} \begin{pmatrix} 
1&\sqrt{2}&1&2\sqrt{2}&4&2\sqrt{2} \\
 \sqrt{2}&0&-\sqrt{2}&4&0&-4 \\ 
 1&-\sqrt{2}&1&-2\sqrt{2}&4&-2\sqrt{2} \\ 
 2\sqrt{2}&4& -2\sqrt{2}&0&0&0 \\ 
 4&0&4&0&0&0 \\ 
  2\sqrt{2}&-4&- 2\sqrt{2}&0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \ee
The block of zeros in the bottom right means that braiding any two of the q-type particles in a given state yields a state orthogonal to the original. We might expect something like this for physical reasons, since braiding a q-type particle through a q-type loop changes the Q-loop's fermion parity, preventing it from fusing to the vacuum, and evaluating to a tadpole diagram. Indeed, this is exactly the same as the reason why $S_{\sigma\sigma}=0$ in the regular Ising theory. A more precise understanding of why the bottom block is zero comes from an analysis of modular transformations on the torus, which we carry out in Section \ref{modulartforms}.   

Instead of tracing the $R$ matrices, we can appeal to a formula relating the $S$ matrix to the topological twists. In bosonic theories, we have 
\be \label{stwist_bosonic} S^{bos}_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c d_c N^{ab}_c \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b}.\ee
This relation does {\it not} hold in the superfusion case, and needs to be modified. By looking at the derivation of \eqref{stwist_bosonic}, \ethan{will draw later} we see that it involves passing vectors in the fusion space $V^{ab}_c$ under a $c$ tube, and then over both an $a$ tube and over a $b$ tube. When the braiding process is embedded in $S^3$, the branch cuts become branch sheets, and so passing an odd vector in $V^{ab}_c$ under a q-type idempotent gives a phase factor of $-1$ (we could also choose this to be obtained when passing over a q-type idempotent). Additionally, vectors in $V^{ab}_c$ are transported in a loop during the derivation of \eqref{stwist_bosonic}, which contributes a sign of $-1$ if the vector is odd. We need to modify the previous relation to take into account both these effects, and so the correct expression for $S$ in the fermionic setting is 
\be S_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c \sum_{v \in V^{ab}_c} d_c (-1)^{|v| (|c|+1)}   \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b},\ee
where $|v| \in \{0,1\}$ is the parity of the vector $v$ and $|c| = 1$ $(|c|=0)$ if $c$ is q-type (m-type). Note that the factor of $(-1)^{|v||c|}$ will only contribute for braids between m-type and q-type particles. 

\begin{comment}
There is a slight technicality here, since our formula for $S$ depends on our choice of twists for the m-type particles, even though we argued that the $S$ matrix should not suffer from the $\pm$ ambiguities that $T$ possesses. This means that the expression must be further modified so as to be invariant under fusing physical fermions onto m-type particles. This is done by writing 
\be S^{Tr}_{ab} = \frac{1}{\mcd} \sum_c \sum_{v \in V^{ab}_c} d_c (-1)^{|v| (|c| + 1) + f(a,b,c)}   \frac{\theta_c}{\theta_a\theta_b},\ee
where $f(a,b,c)$ measures the number of {\it physical} fermions attached to any m-type particles in $a$, $b$ and $c$. For example, if we were to choose $\theta_{m_\unit} = 1, \theta_{m_\psi} = -1,\theta_{m^+_\sigma} = e^{-i\pi/8}$ (e.g, if we chose $\psi$ to come with a single physical fermion attached to it), we would have 
\be {f(a,b,c)} = \delta_{a,m_\psi} + \delta_{b,m_\psi} + \delta_{c,m_\psi}.\ee
The simplest convention is probably to take $m_\unit$ and $m_\psi$ to be bosonic and to use $m_\sigma^+$ as our representative for the $m_\sigma$ isomorphism class, which we have been doing throughout and will continue to do. However, we might also want to take $m_\psi$ to be fermionic, to jive with the Ising theory better. In any case, $S$ is at least independent of this choice.

\subsection{Modular transformations on tori} \label{modulartforms}

If there was no interplay between the spin structure and the string-net pictures drawn on the torus, we would expect $|H_1(T^2;\zt)|=4$ degenerate ground states for each spin structure, since the $\beta$ lines obey the $\zt$ fusion rules of the toric code and, which has four degenerate ground states on the torus. This naive guess is actually incorrect: instead, for each spin structure, one of the four putative ground states turns out to actually have a higher energy than the other three, meaning that there will only be three degenerate ground states for each choice of spin structure. 
For concreteness, we will explicitly list the ground states. For the $(A,A)$ sector, we have the three states 
\be GS_{(A,A)} = \left\{\FubeXXX,\ \FubeXss,\ \FubesXs\right\}.\ee
For periodic boundary conditions around the longitudinal cycle (the shorter cycle, which is horizontal in our pictures), we have 
\be GS_{(P,A)} = \left\{\FubeXXX,\ \FubeXss,\ \FubessX\right\}.\ee
For periodic boundary conditions around the meridional cycle (the big cycle, vertical in our pictures), we have 
\be GS_{(A,P)} = \left\{\FubeXXX,\ \FubesXs,\ \FubessX\right\},\ee
and for periodic boundary conditions around both cycles, we get 
\be GS_{(P,P)} = \left\{\FubesdXs,\ \FubeXsds,\ \FubessdX\right\}.\ee 
Importantly, we wee that all of the ground states on the $(P,P)$ torus have odd fermion parity. This substantiates the evidence for the presence of a background topological superconductor, since a $p\pm ip$ superconductor always has odd fermion parity when placed on a $(P,P)$ torus (cite meng and brayden). 

%Also note that on every torus, there is one additional non-zero picture which lies at higher energy, which can be obtained by drawing the configuration of $\Sigma$ lines not present in the given collection of three pictures, adding on a dot, and creating a massive fermionic excitation somewhere in the background\dave{Not higher energy, but the state is equal to zero.}. For the $(P,P)$ torus, this high-energy state is the empty picture with a massive fermionic excitation (will elaborate later). 

Having three ground states for each spin structure means that we have 12 ground states across all spin structures. This result can also be obtained by tracing the identity functor ${\rm id} = \bigoplus_{a\in\mcz(C_2)} a.$ When we say ``trace out the identity functor'', we mean crossing the tubes in id with an $S^1$ so that they form a collection of tori, embedding them in $S^3$, and evaluating the resulting configuration by filling in the complement of the tubes with a Turaev-Viro state-sum with fixed boundary conditions. Filling in the complement of the tubes with a Turaev-Viro state-sum can only be done if we choose a spin structure on the timelike $S^1$ that can be smoothly extended to a spin structure on a disk, which means that we must choose anti-periodic boundary conditions for the timelike $S^1$. Therefore, only half of the ground states on the collection of tori will come from tracing out id. The rest (on tori with periodic boundary conditions around the meridional cycle) come from tracing out a sort of twisted id functor, which has a $\pi$ flux inserted through the cycle of the $S^1$. \ethan{should move the discussion of what it means to trace stuff out to earlier in the section}

%These arguments make the case for using anti-periodic boundary conditions on the timelike $S^1$ when calculating the twists and braids of the idempotents through the $R$-symbols. All that's left is to decide whether this means we should use the trace or supertrace. At this moment in time, all signs seem to point to the trace being associated with antiperiodic boundary conditions. This is for two reasons. First, we can observe that the using the supertrace to calculate the $S$ matrix in the $qq$ braiding sector gives us something (almost) proportional to $\zeta^2$ (the fact that $S_{q_\sigma q_\sigma}$ isn't may not be a problem), while using the trace gives us a $qq$ $S$-matrix of $0$. We know that we should have $S^4 = -1$ when acting on the ground states of a $(P,P)$ torus, which suggests that the supertrace is what we want to use to compute $S$ for the $(P,P)$ torus. Thus, the supertrace should be associated with periodic boundary conditions along the timelike $S^1$, leaving the trace to be associated with anti-periodic boundary conditions along the timelike $S^1$. 



We are now in a position to give a more compelling argument for why the $qq$ braiding sector of $S$ is $0_{3\times 3}$: evaluating the braiding using the modular transformation picture yields a configuration of tori with incompatible spin structure. Since each q-type idempotent is associated with a torus with $(P,A)$ spin structure (periodic around the spatial $S^1$, anti-periodic around the timelike $S^1$), a double-braid between two q-type particles is obtained by computing the partition function of the two tori in the following picture:
\be \includegraphics{linked_qtori.pdf},\ee
where the two tori are imagined to be embedded inside an ambient $S^3$. 
When we compute this partition function, we thicken the two tori so that their boundaries become glued with one another, forming a torus dividing the ambient $S^3$ into two solid tori. However, we see that the above choice of spin structures makes this gluing process impossible, since the spin structures on the two linked tori do not agree when one another when the tori are glued. More precisely, we see that the boundary conditions on the meridional cycle of one linked torus must match the longitudinal boundary conditions of the other in order for the gluing procedure to be well-defined, which is not the case in the above figure. This means that the partition function of a linking of two q-type idempotents must be zero, which explains the block of zeros in $S^{Tr}$.


In this section, we'll switch to using $A$ in equations rather than just implicitly working with $A^4=i$. Since $d = -A^2 - A^{-2}$, in order to have $d=\sqrt{2}$ we will pick $A = ie^{i\pi/8}$. Also, to make the notation a bit more compact, we will define 
\be e := \FubeXXX,\quad h := \FubesXs,\quad v := \FubeXss,\quad t:= \FubessX,\ee
with the spin structures of the tubes left to be understood in context. As a reminder, we are using the label $(X,Y)$ to denote the spin structure on $T^2$ with boundary condition $X$ along the spatial $S^1$ and boundary condition $Y$ along the timelike $S^1$ (so that e.g. the q-type idempotents are associated with $(P,A)$). This is a bit backwards, depending on how you look at it---might change it later. 

\underline{$\mathbf{(P,P)}$:} First, we'll look at the $(P,P)$ torus, whose spin structure is preserved under both $S$ and $T$. The three vectors in the basis of ground states are $v_\bullet,h_\bullet,$ and $t_\bullet$,
where the $\bullet$s in labels mean that their associated tubes have odd fermion parity (the $h_\bullet$ tube has a $\beta$ string wrapping around its diameter). 
In the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$, we see that 
\be S^{gs}_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 \\ A^4 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \end{pmatrix},\quad T^{gs}_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\ee
One can check that $(ST)^3 = S^4= -\unit_{3\times3}$. Note that $S^{-1} = A^4 S$ (schematically, since the difference between the two is a $\pi$ rotation in framing), so the $S$ matrix is not self-dual as it is for bosonic theories. Also, as a sanity check we see that the eigenvalues of $T$ are $1,\pm A^{-3}$ (if $A^4=i$, then $A^{-3} = e^{i\pi/8}$).

To transform these matrices into the idempotent basis in which $T$ is diagonalized, we take 
\be S \mapsto V^{-1}SV,\ T\mapsto V^{-1}TV,\ee 
where in this case $V$ is the matrix mapping the basis $(q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet})^T$ to the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$. Note that none of $q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet}$ are idempotents in the strict sense of the word, since they multiply together to give even tubes. To ensure they are normalized correctly, we require that they square to their associated even idempotents:
\be q_{\unit\bullet}^2 = q_\unit,\quad q_{\psi\bullet}^2 = q_\psi,\quad q_{\sigma\bullet}^2 = q_\sigma.\ee
In order for this to hold, we see that we need to take
\be q_{\unit\bullet} = \frac{A^{-2}}{2}(v_\bullet + A^3 t_\bullet),\quad q_{\psi\bullet} = \frac{A^{-2}}{2}(v_\bullet - A^3t_\bullet),\quad q_{\sigma\bullet} = \frac{1}{d}h_\bullet.\ee
Therefore, the matrix that maps the basis $(q_{\unit\bullet},q_{\sigma\bullet},q_{\psi\bullet})^T$ to the ground state basis $(v_\bullet,h_\bullet,t_\bullet)^T$ is 
\be V_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} A^{-2}/2 & 0 & A^{-2}/2 \\ 0 & 1/d & 0 \\ A/2 & 0 & -A/2 \end{pmatrix}.\ee
This gives 
\be S_{PP} = \frac{A^2}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & d & 1 \\ d & 0 & d \\ 1 & d & -1 \end{pmatrix},\quad T_{PP} = \begin{pmatrix} A^{-3} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0& 0& -A^{-3}.\end{pmatrix}.\ee
The prefactor of $A^2$ in $S_{PP}$ takes care of the $S^4=-\unit$ constraint for us. 
\ethan{There are some hints that would lead us to expect an $A^{-2}$ in front of $S$ instead.}

\underline{$\mathbf{(A,A)}$:} For the $(A,A)$ spin structure, we see that the $S$-matrix in the ground state basis $(e,v,h)^T$ is $S^{gs}_{(A,A)} = 1\oplus \sigma^x$. The matrix transforming from the idempotent basis $(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)^T$ to the ground state basis is 
\be V_{AA}= \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1&0&1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 1/d & 0 & -1/d \end{pmatrix},\ee
and so we obtain
\be S_{AA} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d & 1 \\ d & 0 & -d \\ 1 & -d & 1 \end{pmatrix} = S_{Ising}.\ee

The $T$-matrix does not preserve the spin structure, as it sends $T : (A,A) \mapsto (A,P)$. As a map between the ground state bases $(e,v,h)^T_{AA}$ and $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$, we have the convenient  
\be T_{AA\mapsto AP}^{gs} = \unit_{3\times 3}.\ee
The matrix mapping the idempotent basis $(m_\unit,m_\sigma^+,m_\psi)^T_{AP}$ onto the ground state basis $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$  is
\be V_{AP} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & A^{-3} & 0 \\ 1/d & 0 & -1/d \end{pmatrix},\ee
which tells us that 
\be T_{AA\mapsto AP} = V_{AP}^{-1} T_{AA\mapsto AP}^{gs} V_{AA} =  \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^3&0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee


\underline{$\mathbf{(P,A)}$:} Now for the $(P,A)$ spin structure, which is preserved by $T$ (as the q-type quasiparticles have well-defined self-statistics). First for the $S$-matrix, which maps the $PA$ spin structure to the $AP$ spin structure. As a map between the ground state basis $(e,v,t)_{PA}^T$ and the ground state basis $(e,t,h)_{AP}^T$, the $S$ matrix is
\be S^{gs}_{PA\mapsto AP} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0& 0 \\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0&1& 0
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
The matrix that maps the idempotent basis $(q_\unit,q_\sigma,q_\psi)^T$ onto the ground state basis $(e,v,t)_{PA}^T$ is 
\be V_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\ A^3/2 & 0 & -A^3/2
\end{pmatrix},\ee
This means that in the idempotent basis, the $S$ matrix is 
\be S_{PA \mapsto AP} = V_{AP}^{-1} S^{top}_{PA \mapsto AP} V_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
d/2 & 1 & d/2 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\ -d/2 & 1 & -d/2
\end{pmatrix}.\ee

Now for $T$, which preserves the spin structure. In the ground state basis basis $(e,v,t)^T$, $T$ takes the form 
\be T^{gs}_{PA} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & A^{-6} \\ 0&1&0 
\end{pmatrix}\ee
which tells us that in the idempotent basis, 
\be T_{PA}  = \begin{pmatrix}
A^{-3} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -A^{-3}
\end{pmatrix}\ee

\underline{$\mathbf{(A,P)}$:} Finally, we turn to the $(A,P)$ spin structure. 
Since the $S$-matrix must be symmetric, we can immediately write 
\be S_{AP \mapsto PA} =  S_{AP \mapsto PA}^T = \begin{pmatrix}
d/2 & 1 & -d/2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ d/2 & -1 & -d/2
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
As a map between the ground state bases $(e,t,h)^T_{AP}$ and $(e,v,h)^T_{AA}$, $T$ is 
\be T^{gs}_{AP \mapsto AA} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^6 &0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee
Therefore, in the idempotent basis, 
\be T_{AP\mapsto AA} = V_{AA}^{-1} T^{gs}_{AP\mapsto AA} V_{AP} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &0&0 \\ 0&A^3&0\\0&0&1
\end{pmatrix}.\ee

\section{$SO(3)_6$ and/or sFib?}
Super example with no $q$ type particles in condensed theory.

\section{$\frac{1}{2}$E6} \label{e6}

\dave{could move to appendix \ethan{too cool for an appendix!} or save for another paper}
\dave{The more I understand about 1/2 E6 the more cool I think it is.}

- introduce 1/2 E6

- explain how to condense fermion despite no braiding

- list idempotents? (yes) quasi-particle fusion? (yes) braiding? (if you really want) 

The fusion category known as $\frac{1}{2}$ E6 has three particles. We denote them $\mathds{1}$, $x$, and $y$. 
The non-trivial fusion rules are
\begin{align}
y \tp y = \mathds{1} \quad \quad y \tp x = x \tp y = x \quad \quad x\tp x = \mathds{1}\oplus 2x \oplus y
\end{align}
We list the associators in App \ref{E6Fsymbols}.
Notice that $x$ is invariant under fusion with $y$, and $y$ is abelian. 
Therefore, condensing the $y$ particle, would result in a fusion category with only two objects, $\mathds{1}$ and $\rho$, the image of $x$ under condensation of $y$.

There is one subtle issue with condensing $y$. 
The fusion category $\frac{1}{2} E6$ is not braided.
This can be resolved by computing the Drinfeld center ${{Z}}(\frac{1}{2} \text{E6})$, which is a modular tensor category.
A generic element in the Drinfeld center is given by an object $A$ from the fusion category and a collection of isomorphisms $e_A$ that define the half braid of $A$ with any object from the fusion category $e_A(x): A \tp x \rightarrow x \tp A$ for all $x$ in the fusion category.
In the center there are two particles with fermionic spin, one of which has $y$ as the object from the fusion category and the half braids defined as,
\begin{align}
\ycenter = \ey - i  \ex -   \eone.
\end{align}
We have used a box to depict the isomorphism $e_y( \; \;)$. 
One can check that this braid is fermionic in both spin and statistics. 

\subsection{Condensed $\frac{1}{2}$ E6}
We can now condense the $y$ particle by using this braiding from the center (Picture).
Since $x$ is invariant under fusion with $y$ after condensation it becomes a Q type simple object, which we denote $\rho$.
Furthurmore, since $x$ had fusion multiplicity in the parent theory, $\rho$, the image of $x$ under condensation will have fusion multiplicity in the condensed theory. 
In summary we have,
\begin{align}
x \xrightarrow{\text{condense $y$}} \rho \quad \quad \text{End}(\rho) \cong \mathbb{C} \ell_1 \quad \quad V^{\rho \rho}_\rho \cong \mathbb{C}^{2|2}
\end{align}
Physically this theory is quite interesting. 
Heuristically, one can thing of the $\rho$ lines as carrying a p-wave superconductor. 
In this scenario the junction of three of these has four different ways to fuse together, two even and two odd. 
\dave{Mention something like quantum dimensions of abelian Q type particles is $\sqrt{2}$, as it is for Ising, and so this is an example of a non-Abelian Q type.}
In fact, one may wonder if there exists a super fusion category, with only one Q type simple object, and no fusion multiplicity. 
It turns out this is impossible as we explain in SECXXX.
Hence, this is the ``simplest" non-abelian purely Q type theory.

Lets denote the odd endomorphism in $\text{End}(\rho)$ as $\gamma$. And let us denote the basis vectors in $V^{\rho \rho}_\rho$ as $v_1$ and $v_2$. 
Lets also take $v_1$ and $v_2$ to be of even parity, and canonically identify there odd counterparts by ${v_1}_\gamma$ and ${v_{2}}_\gamma$. 
These are just found by acting with $\gamma$ on the bottom of the trivalent vertex. 
We have the following local relations inherited on the trivalent vertices from the parent theory,
\dave{Will use pictures for this when I have a chance to make them.}
\begin{align}
{(V^{\rho \rho}_\rho)_\gamma} = \sigma^z \; ^{\gamma} (V^{\rho \rho}_\rho) \quad \quad {(V^{\rho \rho}_\rho)_\gamma} = \sigma^y \; (V^{\rho \rho}_\rho)^{\gamma} \quad \quad  ^{\gamma} (V^{\rho \rho}_\rho) = -i \sigma^x (V^{\rho \rho}_\rho)^{\gamma}
\end{align}
 Notice that $V^{\rho \rho}_\rho$ is a representation of $\mathbb{C} \ell_2$.

This theory does not exist. 
A quick way to see this is by looking at the fusion vertex $V^{\tau \tau \tau}$. 
Denote $\gamma \in \text{End}(\tau)$ as the odd endomorphism.
Then we can write down three anti-commuting operators $\gamma \tp \gamma \tp 1$, $\gamma \tp 1 \tp \gamma$ and $1\tp \gamma \tp \gamma$. 
Furthurmore these operators are even and so they preserve the grading on $\mathbb{C}^{1|1}$. 
But the even and odd subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^{1|1}$ are one dimensional and so these operators cannot be represented.
Hence a theory with Fibonacci like fusion rules of Q-type particles must have fusion multiplicity.

 \section{Super fusion categories}
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
Goal: Define super fusion categories for target audience. Target audience = physicists who have spent some time in Appendix E of Kitaev's 2006 anyon paper. 

\subsection{Simple objects}
We will assume that our category is {\it idempotent complete} -- 
every idempotent is the identity morphism of an associated object.
Simple objects correspond to minimal idempotents.
%In an ordinary fusion category simple objects have the defining feature that there endomorphisms are given by $\mathbb{C}$.
%This is because any simple algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ is Morita equivalent to $\mathbb{C}$. \ethan{true, 
In ordinary fusion categories, the endomorphism ring of any simple object is the trivial algebra $\cc$. 
This is due to Schur's lemma: if an object $x$ is simple, then any morphism in $\End(x)$ 
must be an isomorphism, and hence $\End(x) = \cc$. 
Objects with $\End(x) = \cc$ are still possible in the more general fermionic setting we consider here, 
and we will refer to them as {\it m-type} objects.
\kw{If we are going to use the [mq]-type terminology, then it probably we should have already introduced
the classification of simple super algebras $M(p,q)$, $Q(n)$ and the Morita equivalences between them.
Could possibly go in an appendix.}

As we saw in the Ising example, the endomorphisms of simple objects in fermionic theories aren't always $\mathbb{C}$, and may instead be a simple super algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. 
By Schur's lemma every element in $\End(x)$ is invertible if $x$ is simple, and so $\End(x)$ must be a division algebra. 
The only $\zz_2$-graded division algebra is the first complex Clifford algebra $\cl_1$, 
%As was the case for the image of $\sigma$ under condensation.
%All simple super algebras are Morita equivalent to the clifford algebra with one odd generator $\mathbb{C} \ell_1$\cite{wall1964}.
which is generated by two elements: $1$ and an odd generator $\Gamma$ satisfying $\Gamma^2 = \lambda$. 
(If we change basis by replacing $\Gamma$ with $a \Gamma$ (for any non-zero $a\in \cc$), then this relation becomes
$\Gamma^2 = a^2\lambda$.
So we may assume $\lambda$ is any non-zero complex number.)
\kw{added above to be consistent with the discussion below.}
Generic elements in $\cl_1$ are complex linear combinations of $1$ and $\Gamma$.
The simplest vector space representing $\cl_1$ is the super vector space $\mathbb{C}^{1|1}$.
We will refer to simple objects whose endomorphism algebra is $\cl_1$ as {\it q-type} objects.
In summary, our terminology is 
\begin{align}
\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=25mm{
& \text{End}(x) = \mathbb{C} \ar@{<->}[rr] &   &\text{$x$ is a simple m-type object}&  \\
&\text{End}(x) = \mathbb{C} \ell_1 \ar@{<->}[rr]  &  &\text{$x$ is a simple q-type object}&
	}}
\end{align}

$$
$$
- review irreducible representations of super algebra's via \cite{jozefiak1988}??

- Duality axiom?
$$
$$



A defining feature of a simple object is the quantum dimension
\begin{align}
d_x = \text{Tr} \; x = \text{picture}
\end{align}

\dave{I need to double check this.}
Now lets look at some consistency equations on $Q$ type particles.
\kw{maybe should say that the dot is a odd endomorphism whose square is $\lambda$}
Define 
\begin{align}
\TwodotCap =  \lambda_{\text{cap}} \; \Qcap \quad \quad
\TwodotCup =  \lambda_{\text{cup}}\; \Qcup \quad \quad
\Qdotdot =  \lambda \; \QIdentity
\end{align}
With these definitions one can show that
\begin{align}
\QCapDotL =(-\lambda_{\text{cap}}^{-1} \lambda )\; \QCapDotR \qquad \qquad \QCapDotR  = (\lambda_{\text{cap}}^{-1} \lambda ) \; \QCapDotL\\ 
\\
\QCupDotR= (-\lambda_{\text{cup}}^{-1} \lambda )\; \QCupDotL \qquad \qquad \QCupDotL  = (\lambda_{\text{cup}}^{-1} \lambda) \; \QCupDotR
\end{align}
\kw{I think it would be more straightforward to make $(-\lambda_{\text{cap}}^{-1} \lambda ) = \pm i$ the fundamental constant,
since it does not change if we rescale the fermionic dot.}
\dave{I agree.}
Applying the relation twice must be equivalent to doing nothing, so that we have $\lambda^2 = -\lambda_{\text{cap}}^2$ and $\lambda^2 = -\lambda_{\text{cup}}^2$.
The spin structure guarantees that when a fermion goes around a loop which bounds a disk it must pick up a minus sign. 
Therefore we also have, $\lambda^2 = -\lambda_{\text{cap}} \lambda_{\text{cup}}$.
Altogether, these relations imply that $\lambda_{\text{cup}} = \lambda_{\text{cap}}$, and also $(-\lambda_{\text{cap}} \lambda)^2 = -1$.
And we conclude that a dot slide must be purely imaginary. It is convenient to define clockwise dot slides as
\begin{align}
&\QCapDotL =\Omega \; \QCapDotR \quad \quad \QCupDotR= \Omega \; \QCupDotL \quad \quad \Omega^* = -\Omega, \quad \lambda^4 >0
\end{align}
\dave{It would be good if we could show $\lambda^4>0$, but not sure how.} \ethan{$\lambda^4=1$ means that we can remove eight fermions for free, which we expect from the whole $\zz_8$ fermion classification thing.}
\kw{If I'm understanding you correctly, then there are no restrictions on $\lambda$ until we consider orientation-reversing maps (reflections).
By rescaling the dot we can make $\lambda$ any non-zero number.}


\subsection{Fusion spaces}

The set of input data for a super fusion category will not only constitute a list of simple objects and their types (Q or M), but also their fusion rules. 
The fusion rules can be encapsulated by integers $N_c^{ab} = p+q$ 
%taking values in $\zz_{p+q}$, 
\kw{I'm confused by this $\zz_{p+q}$ notation.}
\dave{fixed.}
%\begin{align}
%N_{c}^{ab} = 0, 1, \cdots p, p+1, \cdots p+q+1
%\end{align}
where $p$ ($q$) is the number of even (odd) ways that $a$ and $b$ can fuse to $c$.
Therefore, the graded vector space assigned to the fusion space of $a$ and $b$ into $c$ is $\mathbb{C}^{p|q}$:
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_c \cong \mathbb{C}^{p|q}
\end{align}
For any homogeneous vector $\ket{\psi} \in V^{ab}_c$ 
we will denote its grading by $|\psi| \in \{ 0, 1\}$, where $0$ is even parity and $1$ is odd.
If any of the particles $a,b,c$ involved in the fusion are q-type, then there are always as many even fusion channels as odd ones, and the space is of the form $\mathbb{C}^{p|p}$.
This follows from the fact that $Q$ type particles always possess odd isomorphisms, which imply that the even and odd parts of the fusion space in question are isomorphic, and hence have the same dimension. 
\dave{Can we show $m \tp m \rightarrow q$ is not allowed? This seems plausible.}
\kw{No.  In the $C_{2n}$ examples ($A_{4n-1}$ modulo a fermion), the tensor generator is m-type if $n > 1$.
But eventually it tensor-generates a q-type object.}
\dave{Right. That's interesting. Thanks. I'll add a comment on this at some point.}
\dave{Contrast an $m \tp m \rightarrow m$ fusion space of super dimension $(p|p)$ with a $q \tp q \rightarrow m$ fusion space of super dimension $(p|p)$.}

Because of the anti-commuting nature of super vector spaces, taking tensor products in super vector spaces requires defining an ordering of the vectors in the tensor product.
\kw{perhaps should remark somewhere that it is not convenient to do the usual thing
and inherit an ordering from the order of the symbols in the equation.
This is because our $V^{ab}_c$'s are associated to points in a 2- (or perhaps 3-) manifold.
It's less error-prone to explicitly put the ordering-number beside each (potential) fermion.
Perhaps this is already discussed above in the examples?}
\dave{I agree. I don't think we've included such a discussion yet, but we definitely should.}
We will write $V^{ab}_{c,n}$ to designate that the vector space $V^{ab}_c$ appears as the $n$th term in a tensor product (although when we are only talking about one fusion vertex we may omit the subscript).
Depending on the parity of the vectors involved, interchanging two indices may result in the interchange of two fermions, for which we pick up a minus sign. 
% [KW: "braiding structure" is not the right term here -- nothing is moving around in a manifold, we're just changing the sign-ordering]  Thus, superfusion categories possess a canonical braiding structure given by the Koszul sign rule:
%\dave{Need to think about tensoring over endmorphisms, how these play together, and also when we 'extend' the vector space so that local moves implement tensoring over endomorphisms.}
%\begin{align}
%P_{12}: \; \; &V^{ab}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,2} \rightarrow V^{ab}_{c,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,1} \\
%		  & \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \mapsto (-1)^{|\psi| |\eta|} \ket{\psi} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} \ket{\eta}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
 &P_{12}: \; \;V^{ab}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,2} \ar[r]            & V^{ab}_{c,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xy}_{z,1} \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (-1)^{|\psi| |\eta|} \ket{\psi} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} \ket{\eta}
	}} \quad \quad \ket{\psi} \in V^{ab}_{c} \;\; \text{and} \;\;  \ket{\eta} \in V^{xy}_{z}
\end{align}
This just says that if both $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\eta}$ are odd vectors, then we pick up a factor of $-1$ when we interchange them in a tensor product. 

There is an important subtlety involved when we tensor together fusion spaces involving q-type particles to form fusion diagrams. To see where this comes from, suppose $x$ is a q-type particle, and consider the resolution of the identity 
\begin{align} \label{resid}
\Hom(x,x) \cong \bigoplus_y \Hom(x,y) \tp_\cc \Hom(y,x).
\end{align}
\kw{should we say that $x$ is any object and that the sum is over simple objects $y$?}
The above relation is actually {\it incorrect}, since if $x$ is simple then this reads $\Hom(x,x) = \Hom(x,x) \tp_\cc \Hom(x,x)$, which since $\End(x) = \cl_1$ implies $\cl_1 \cong \cl_1\tp \cl_1 \cong \cl_2$, a contradiction. In order to fix this, we need to mod out by ``internal'' degrees of freedom carried by q-type particles. 

Graphically, modding out by these internal degrees of freedom is equivalent to modding out by local relations involving q-type particles. 
These relations are given by locally creating pairs of fermions and by sliding fermions from one fusion vertex to another:
 \begin{align}
\LocalRelationUp \sim \LocalRelationDown \quad \quad  \LocalRelationLeft \sim \LocalRelationRight \lambda^{-1} .
\label{FusionSpaceRelation}
 \end{align}
%\kw{I think you need to use $-\lambda^{-1}$ or change the ordering}
%\dave{Agreed. Changed ordering to be consistent with other diagrams.}
Since the first equivalence relation can be derived from the second, and vice versa, both relations define the same equivalence class on the fusion space.
A tensor product taken over a q-type particle must be quotiented by isomorphisms like this. Explicitly, 
\be \ba
 &V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d,2}\quad  \text{is replaced by} \quad V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,2}, \text{ and} \\ 
  &V^{ax}_{c,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{x,2}\quad  \text{is replaced by} \quad V^{ax}_{b,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{bc}_{x,2},
\ea 
\ee
where $\tp_{\End(x)}$ means that $\End(x)$ is taken to be the tensor unit. Explicitly, 
%\begin{align}
%V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,1} \equiv V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,1}/\langle (V^{ab}_{x,2} \circ f_3) \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,1} \sim V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f_3\circ V^{xc}_{d,1}) \rangle
%\label{qtensor}
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,2} = V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,2}/ \sim,
\label{qtensor}
\end{align}
where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation 
\begin{align} \label{equivreln}
(V^{ab}_{x,1} f_3) \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{xc}_{d,2} \sim V^{ab}_{x,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f_3 V^{xc}_{d,2})
\end{align}
for all $f \in \text{End}(x)$.
Likewise, we have $V^{ax}_d \tp_{\End(x)} V^{bc}_x = V^{ax}_d \tp_\cc V^{bc}_x / \sim$, where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation $(V^{ax}_{d,1} f_3) \tp_{\mathbb{C}}V^{bc}_{x,2} \sim V^{ax}_{d,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f_3 V^{bc}_{x,2})$ for all $f\in \End(x)$. 

\dave{Maybe we should be more careful about the defintion of $f$? Perhaps we should have 3 versions. One for upper left leg, one for upper right, and one for bottom leg. It's almost the same issue as adding and removing identity lines in normal fusion categories.}


Using the modified tensor product allows us write down the correct version of \eqref{resid}, which is 
\begin{align}
\Hom(x,x) \cong \bigoplus_y \Hom(x,y) \tp_{\End(y)} \Hom(y,x).
\end{align}
In particular, if $x$ is a simple q-type object, then we (correctly) have $\cl_1 \cong \Hom(x,x) \cong \Hom(x,x)\tp_{\End(x)} \Hom(x,x) \cong \cl_1\tp_{\cl_1}\cl_1 \cong \cl_1$.  

Quotienting by the local relations in (\ref{FusionSpaceRelation}) is reminiscent of superconductivity. 
Indeed the relation says that pairs of fermions can be freely created and removed as well as hopped along Q-type edges. 
A fermionic phase of matter will generate such terms at second order in perturbation theory when proximity coupled to an  ordinary superconductor.
Thus, heuristically, we can think of Q-type particles as the result of proximity induced superconductivity on a super fusion category with only M-type particles.

%This is idea is very important in the general theory of superfusion categories, and so we devote the next section to examining its consequences in more detail. 

%\subsection{Tensor product}
%In this section we elaborate on taking tensor products in superfusion categories. 
%For m-type particles, the tensor product is taken over $\mathbb{C}$, as usual. 

%As mentioned above, this is not the case for tensor products involving q-type particles. In general, we need to quotient out by endomorphism rings when taking tensor products, as in \eqref{qtensor}.

To take the quotient in \eqref{qtensor} explicitly (which we must do when performing calculations numerically), we impose the condition that physical vectors in the space $V^{ab}_x \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_d$ be left invariant under the action of $\text{End}(x)$. 
%For a q-type particle $x$, we have $\End(x) \cong \cl_1$. Each of the two generators of $\cl_1$ results in an isomorphism of the fusion spaces defined by
There are two types of fusion diagrams we need to consider, depending how the fusion vertices that they are formed from are connected. This leads to two isomorphisms of fusion diagrams:
\begin{align}
&\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
 &L_f: \; \;V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d,1} \ar[r]            & V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{d,1}  \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (f\ket{\psi}) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f^{-1} \ket{\eta})  
		  }} \quad \quad f \in \text{End}(x)\\
		  \\		  
&		  \vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @C=42mm{
		  &R_f: \; \;V^{ay}_{d,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{y,2} \ar[r]            & V^{ay}_{d,1} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{bc}_{y,2} \\
		  &\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \ket{\psi}\tp_\mathbb{C} \ket{\eta}  \ar@{|->}[r] & (f\ket{\psi}) \tp_{\mathbb{C}} (f^{-1} \ket{\eta})
	}}	\quad \quad f \in \text{End}(y)
	\end{align}
Importantly, we note that both $L_f$ and $R_f$ are always {\it even} maps, regardless of the parity of $f$. 

Tensoring over endomorphisms in a fusion space is equivalent to requiring the fusion space to be invariant under the action of $L_f$ and $R_f$. 
Said another way, any vectors related by application of $L_f$ or $R_f$ are considered equivalent, which makes it natural to think of $L_f$ and $R_f$ as gauge transformations, since they encode redundancy in physical vector spaces.

It is often useful to do calculations %in the ``extended" vector space, i.e., where we compute with 
by working with explicit choices of representatives of vectors in each isomorphism class, imposing the requirement that any diagrammatic manipulation commutes with all endomorphisms generated by $L_f$ and $R_f$. 
After doing calculations, we can project back onto the physical subspace by modding out by the equivalence relation \eqref{equivreln}. 
This can be done provided that $L_f$ and $R_f$ commute on any fusion diagram. For example, for a fusion diagram built from three fusion vertices, we require that
\begin{align}
L_{f, 32}L_{g,21} V^{ab}_{x,3} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{y,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{yd}_{w,1} = L_{g,21} L_{f, 32} V^{ab}_{x,3} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{xc}_{y,2} \tp_{\mathbb{C}} V^{yd}_{w,1} 
\end{align}
for all $f \in \text{End}(x)$ and $g \in \text{End}(y)$. 
\dave{Need to show this.}
%In fact this is always the case, since as mentioned earlier both $L_f$ and $R_f$ are even maps. 
%Although they may have a nontrivial action on the fusion spaces.
From now, when we write $\tp$ we will always mean $\tp_\cc$, unless specified otherwise.

\dave{Let $V^{ab}_x$ be a fusion vertex of $3$ Q type particles. Then if $U_L$ is the action of sliding a dot up past the vertex to the left and similarly $U_R$ for sliding a dot up to the right. Then you can show that $U_L = U_L^{-1}$ and $U_R = U_R^{-1}$ and $U_L U_R = - U_R U_L$.}

\subsection{F-symbols}
\kw{Probably there should be some figures to accompany the definition of $F$ and the pentagon eqn.
Also, $F$ depends on a choice of ordering of the trivalent vertices on either side of the ``I = H" relation.}
\dave{Definitely agree. It was just faster to type it out on the first run through this section. I'll add figures to most or all of the equations as I go through it again.}

As usual the $F$-symbols are defined as basis transformations between different fusion spaces, although in our case we must account for our quotienting procedure in their definition. Therefore, we define the $F$-symbols as
\begin{align}
F^{abc}_d: \; \; \bigoplus_x V^{ab}_{x,2} \tp_{\text{End}(x)} V^{xc}_{d,1} \rightarrow \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_{d,1} \tp_{\text{End}(y)} V^{bc}_{y,2}
\end{align}
We require that the F-symbols commute with the gauge transformations $L,R$ that implement the tensor product over $\End(x)$, and so the following diagram must commute:
\begin{align}
	\vcenter{\xymatrix @!0 @M=1mm @R=30mm @C=42mm{
		 \bigoplus_x V^{ab}_{x,2} \otimes V^{xc}_{d,1} \ar[d]^{L_{f}}\ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}& \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_{d,1} \otimes V^{bc}_{y,2} \ar[d]^{R_{g}} \\
		\bigoplus_x V^{ab}_{x,2} \otimes V^{xc}_{d,1}  \ar[r]^{F^{abc}_d}  & \bigoplus_y V^{ay}_{d,1} \otimes V^{bc}_{y,2}	
	}} 
	{ \quad\quad \forall f \in \oplus_x \text{End}(x), \; \; g \in \oplus_y \text{End}(y)}
	\label{Fcommute}
\end{align}
In matrix form, this means that we require 
\be
F^{abc}_d  L_f=   R_g F^{abc}_d.
\ee

In the superfusion case, the pentagon relation is equivalent to the commutativity of the following diagram:

where we have used the notation $\tp_x \equiv \tp_{\text{End}(x)}$. Note that this is actually a hexagon, not a pentagon: the extra arrow is the one marked $P_{23}$, which is the Kozul sign originating from switching the normal-ordering of the $V^{yt}_s$ and $V^{z2}_t$ fusion spaces. 
The use of the modified tensor products $\tp_x$ is how (\ref{endoPentagon}) differs from the ``super pentagon" equation which, has already appeared in the literature REFXXX.

In practice, it is often easier to first solve the pentagon equation in the ``extended space'' by replacing all $\tp_x$ tensor products with $\tp$ (yielding the super pentagon equation), and then requiring the resulting $F$-symbols to satisfy the constraint (\ref{Fcommute}).

\dave{We should think about to what extent all super fusion categories can be realized by fermion condensation}

\dave{We should also ask when this process is reversible, i.e., can we ``guage" fermion parity and get back to a bosonic fusion category}

\dave{Is there an underlying bosonic fusion category associated with every super fusion category? Usher answered this in the case with no q-type particles, and it was yes.} 

\kw{are we sure that Usher did not consider q-type objects?}

\dave{From what I recall, he mentions them but didn't do much beyond that. I'll go back and check. I'll also ask Ethan, he's more familiar with Usher's paper than me.}
\dave{Note to self: Usher mentions $C_2$ in example 6.8.}

For a simple q-type object we have

\subsection{Pivotal structure}
Here we remark on the pivotal structure of the super fusion category.
We have the frobenius Schur indicator given by
\begin{align}
&\kappa_a: \;\; V^{a \bar{a}} \tp_{\text{End}(\bar{a})} V_{\bar{a}a} \rightarrow V^a_a \\
&\tilde{\kappa}_a: \;\; V_{a \bar{a}} \tp_{\text{End}(\bar{a})} V^{\bar{a}a} \rightarrow V^a_a
\end{align}
\dave{inverse.}
which is a special case of the pivot:
%\dave{Could either do this (and also specify the dual spaces)}
%\begin{align}
%A^{ab}_c:&\;\; V^{\bar{a}a} \tp_{\text{End}({a})}  V^{ab}_c \rightarrow V_{\bar{a} c}^b \\
%B^{ab}_c:&\;\; V^{ab}_c \tp_{\text{End}(b)}  V^{b\bar{b}} \rightarrow V^{a}_{c\bar{b}}
%\end{align}
%--OR--
\begin{align}
&X^{ab}_c: \; \; V_{\bar{c} c} \tp_{c} V^{ab}_c \tp_{b} V^{b \bar{b}} \rightarrow V^{\bar{c} a}_{\bar{b}} \\
&\tilde{X}^{ab}_c: \; \; V^{\bar{a} a} \tp_a V^{ab}_c \tp_c V_{c \bar{c}} \rightarrow V^{b \bar{c}}_{\bar{a}}
\end{align}

%\section{Fusion category review}
%\ethan{I don't think we really need this in the paper. It isn't anything original, and we're not going to do a better job of explaining things than any of the other reviews of this stuff that are out there (e.g. Kitaev) --- we should just refer readers to them (and all of our readers will likely know this stuff anyway). Given that we introduce the F-symbols and pivotal stuff and everything in the superfusion case anyway, it also seems redundant to do them here as well --- we can always obtain the stuff in this section as a special case of the stuff in the superfusion section if we like. }
%\dave{Agreed.}

%In this section we give a brief review of fusion categories. 
%Physically one can think of the diagrams as the world lines of ``particles" in a $1+1$ dimensional theory.
%For example this could be considered as the topological theory associated to a gapped boundary of a $2+1$ dimensional topological phase. 
%must add:

%- identity object

%- duality axiom

%- normalizations/quantum dimensions

%- inner product

%A fusion category {\cal C} is a collection of data; a list of simple objects $\{a, b, \cdots, \}$, fusion rules $N_{ab}^c$, and F-symbols. 
%Physically we think of a simple object as the collection of states which is invariant under local operations. 
%More formally we would say that the space of maps from $a$ to it'self is just a complex number times the identity\begin{align}
%\text{End}(a,a) \cong \mathbb{C} \text{id}_a.
%\end{align}
%This is the definition of a {\em simple object} in a fusion category {\cal C}. 
%One could consider objects that aren't simple, but we require that such an object always decomposes into a direct sum of simple objects, for example, $A = \oplus_i x_i$, where each $x_i$ is simple. 
%In this case we have $\text{Hom}(A,A)= \oplus_i \text{Hom}(x_i,x_i)$ (picture). 
%This is the definition of {\em semisimple}, which says that each object can always be decomposed into a finite sum of simple objects.

%Diagrammatically we represent this space as a set of labeled points on a circle or line. (picture).
%Physically these particles should be thought of as local excitations which are well separated.
%The ``time evolution" maps this set of states to another on a circle or a line (picture). 
%During time evolution two neighbouring particles may be brought together and can fuse.
%Such a process is called fusion and given the semi-simplicity condition, we know that the result can be split into a direct sum of particles.
%We will label the fusion space that takes $a \otimes b$ to $c$ by $V_{ab}^c \cong \text{Hom}(a\otimes b, c)$. 
%The dimension of this vector space is known as the fusion multiplicity $N_{ab}^c = \text{dim} V_{ab}^c$. 
%We can choose a basis for this fusion space by $v_{ab; \mu}^c \in V_{ab}^c$ with $\mu = 1, \cdots, N_{ab}^c$, diagrammatically we write,
%\begin{align}
%v_{ab; \mu}^c = \text{(picture)}.
%\end{align}
%There is the adjoint space $V_{c}^{ab}$ which splits particle $c$ into particles $a$ and $b$.
%The identity operator on the space $a \otimes b$ is given by 
%\begin{align}
%\text{id}_a \otimes \text{id}_b \cong \oplus_c V^{ab}_c \circ V^c_{ab}
%\end{align}
%Indeed, any evolution of particles can be decomposed in this way, 
%\begin{align}
%V_{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_r}^{y_1 y_2 \cdots y_w} = \oplus V^{y_1 y_2}_{z_1} \otimes V^{z_1 y_2}_{z_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{z_{w-1} y_w}_{z_w} \circ V^{z_w}_{z_{w+1} x_r} \otimes V^{z_{w+1}}_{ z_{w+2} x_{r-1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{z_{w+r-1}}_{x_1 x_2}
%\end{align}
%\begin{align}
%V_{x_1 x_2 \cdots}^{y_1 y_2 \cdots}  = \oplus_z V^{y1 y2}_z \circ V^{z y_3 \cdots}_{x_1 x_2 \cdots }
%\end{align}
%applying this rule recursively in the fusion and splitting spaces allows one to decompose the operator into fusion and splitting vectors. 

%Of course this decomposition is arbitrary, we weren't forced to fuse $y_1$ and $y_2$ first, we could have equally well fused $y_2$ and $y_3$ first. 
%Since the resulting vector spaces are isomorphic, we know that there has to be an isomorphism between these fusion processes. 
%The isomorphism is known as the F-symbol and defines the linear map, \dave{need to add notation for tracking the spaces.}
%\begin{align}
%F^{abc}_d: \oplus_x V^{ab}_x \tp V^{xc}_{d} \rightarrow \oplus_y V^{ay}_d \tp V^{bc}_y
%\end{align}
%We will often adopt the notation for matrix elements of the F-symbol in a particular basis given by,
%\begin{align}
%v^{ab}_{x; \mu} \tp v^{x c}_{d; \nu} = \sum_{\sigma, y \rho} \left[ F^{abc}_d \right]_{\mu x \nu ; \sigma y \rho} v^{ay}_{d; \rho} \tp v^{bc}_{y; \sigma}
%\end{align}
%and diagrammatically this is written (picture).

% - The F-symbols are subject to a consistency condition known as the pentagon equation
%....

%The pentagon equation must be compatible with the pivotal structure.

\section{Spin and Pin structures}

\subsubsection{Spin structures}
\ethan{the following is copied from our previous notes: will clean up (and correct mistakes) later}

Tubes, being fermionic objects, need to come with spin structures in order for the fermions that live on them to be well-defined. In this subsection, we'll briefly review what spin structures are, and how we can classify them for the manifolds we'll be working over. 

%The procedure for condensing the fermions follows from introducing a co-dimension $1$ defect membrane $W$ that can absorb and emit fermions in pairs.
%In the following we will assume the defect is co-planar to the spatial directions.

Since fermions carry spin and braiding statistics and as such are not transparent, they cannot be condensed without some additional help. This is provided by the
existence of codimension-1 membranes equipped with spin structures, which are devices used to %membrane $W$, which is equipped with a certain structure that
``transparentize'' the fermions, allowing them to be condensed. 
%More precisely, we say that the membrane $W$ endows the spacetime manifold $M$ we're working over with a spin structure. 
Very loosely, a spin structure is a bundle over a manifold $M$ that associates the location of each $2\pi$-twisted fermion worldine with a factor of $-1$, which cancel out the factors of $-1$ picked up upon untwisting $2\pi$-twisted worldlines and allows for the ``transparentization'' process to go through. %Thus, a spin structure is a way of forming a $\zt$ bundle over the configuration space of fermionic worldlines. 

To make this more precise, we frame fermions by thinking of them from the ribbon point of view, and look at the vector bundle of fermion framings over $M$. If the fermions were bosonic, the structure group of this vector bundle would just be $SO(n)$, since rotating the framing by $2\pi$ at a given point would be equivalent to doing nothing\footnote{Here we are assuming that $M$ is oriented so that we can choose a structure group of $SO(n)$ rather than $O(n)$.}. However, since fermions are (of course) fermionic, a $2\pi$ twist in their framing at a given point is not equivalent to doing nothing, and instead gives us a $-1$ sign. This means that relations between $SO(n)$ representations (like $R_\pi^2 = 1$) only hold projectively when applied to fermions. Therefore, we define the group $Spin(n)$ though the short exact sequence
\be 1 \ra \zt \ra Spin(n) \ra SO(n) \ra 1,\ee
so that representations of $Spin(n)$ are $\zt$-projective representations of $SO(n)$ representations. 

Giving a manifold $M$ a spin structure is then equivalent to equipping its vector bundle of fermion framings a $Spin(n)$ action. This can be encapsulated by the short exact sequence 
\be 1 \ra \zt \ra FSp(M) \ra FSO(M) \ra 1,\ee
where $FSO(M)$ is the oriented frame bundle on $M$ (with $SO(n)$ as the structure group) and $FSp(M)$ is the oriented spin-frame bundle on $M$, which is like $FSO(M)$ but with structure group $Spin(n)$. 

However, not all exact sequences above are physically allowable. We must place a further constraint on the spin bundle, namely that it must be ``untwisted''. If the bundle were twisted, we could go around contractible loops and get a nontrivial holonomies, which would prevent us from constructing a well-defined transparentization procedure. The ``untwistedness'' of the bundle corresponds precisely to the condition that the second Stiefel-Whitney class $\omega_2 \in H^2(M,\zt)$ used to define the twisting of the bundle be trivial ($\omega_2$ is the 2-cocycle associated with $M$'s tangent bundle). For the examples we're interested this can shown to always be the case, since we will always have $H^2(M,\zt) = 0$. This then implies that any 2-cochain $\omega_2$ on $M$ can be written as $\omega_2 = \delta \eta$ for some 1-cochain $\eta \in H^1(M,\zt)$, meaning that different spin structures are parametrized by the group $H^1(M,\zt)$, which is usually easy to calculate, and physically corresponds to a choice of fermionic boundary conditions around the noncontrabile loops in $M$. This agrees with our interpretation of a spin structure in terms of the ``codimension-1 back wall'' picture, since Poincare duality allows us to associate any element in $H^1(M,\zt)$ with a codimension-1 submanifold of $M$.

In particular, there are two spin structures on a cylinder (vortex or no vortex), and four on a pair of pants. From the structure of $H^1(S^2_n,\zt)$ and the duality between $H^1(S^2_2,\zt)$ and $H_1(S^2_n,\zt)$, we see that spin structures are determined by picking a choice of boundary conditions for fermions along $(n-1)$ of the punctures, with the boundary condition around the $n$th puncture then being uniquely determined. On the cylinder and on tori we have a canonical identification of spin structures with elements in $H^1(M,\zt)$, but this is not true in general. 
This is because in general there is no correspondence between an ``identity'' spin structure and the identity element in $H^1(M,\zt)$: spin structures are an $H^1(M,\zt)$ torsor. 

In what follows we will need to deal with the action of orientation-reversing reflections, which means that we will actually need the more general construction of a Pin$^\pm$ structure. Colloquially, a Pin$^\pm$ structure is to a Spin structure what $O(n)$ is to $SO(n)$. That is, we have a short exact sequence 
\be \label{pinseq} 1\ra \spin(n) \ra \pin^\pm(n) \ra \zt \ra 1,\ee 
where the last map $p : \pin^\pm(n) \ra \zt$ sends orientation-reversing (orientation-preserving) elements to $-1$ ($+1$). Alternatively, we can describe $\pin^\pm(n)$ through the relation $\pin^\pm(n) / \{1,-1\} \cong O(n)$, where the $-1$ in the quotient is identified with a $2\pi$ rotation. The difference between $\pin^+$ and $\pin^-$ is the way in which reflection acts: reflection squares to $1$ in $\pin^+$ and to $-1$ in $\pin^-$, corresponding to whether \eqref{pinseq} splits ($\pin^+$) or does not ($\pin^-$). In what follows, we will fix a $\pin^+$ structure for concreteness. 

Physically, the spin structure can be thought of as a theory of physical fermions.%, for example a $p+ip$ superconductor.
The condensation process then accounts for taking the emergent fermionic particle, pairing it with the physical fermion and then condensing the bosonic composite particle\dave{Refer to figure.}.

\section{Tube algebra} \label{tubeapp}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\ethan{this section will definitely be improved at a later point (I'll also try to trim down on all the formal baggage that we don't really need)}
In this section, we give an introduction to the tube algebra and show how its construction is modified in the fermionic setting. 

\subsubsection{Intuitive idea}

We will work on a sphere with $n$ punctures, with a quasiparticle excitation localized at the location of each puncture. Acting with the elements of the fube algebra on this manifold amounts to fusing in fubes at the location of each puncture, which adds in more space around the location of each quasiparticle and is essentially like changing how zoomed-in our view of the quasiparticles is. This means that when we fuse fubes into the manifold, we are essentially doing an ``RG flow'' on the quasiparticles -- if the quasiparticles are stable and represent well-defined topological excitations, they must be invariant under this re-scaling procedure. This means that we can always associate quasiparticles with vector spaces that are invariant under the action of the fube algebra. Finding such vector spaces is the same thing as finding the simple modules of the fube algebra, which in turn is the same thing as computing the fube algebra's central primitive idempotents. 

\subsubsection{Formal aspects}

Now we will formalize these ideas. For any manifold $M$, define the supervector space $\fld(M)$ as 
\be \fld(M) = \{\text{$\cc$-linear combinations of field configurations on $M$}\} / (\text{local relations}), \ee
where ``field configurations on $M$'' are string-net pictures drawn on $M$ with the strings labeled by the objects of the superfusion category we're working with, and the local relations consist of performing $F$-moves, removing contractible loops, and doing other operations that are allowed by the superfusion category data. Note that the super nature of $\fld(M)$ prevents us from adding together any two field configurations with different fermion parity. Also note that endomorphisms of $\fld(M)$ can always be represented by elements of $\fld(M\times [0,1])$, and so \be \fld(M\times[0,1]) \cong \fld(M)^*,\ee
where $\fld(M)^*$ is the linear dual of $\fld(M)$. For example, if $C$ is the cylinder then $\fld(C) = \fld(S^1)^*$. 

Finally, note that for us the manifold $M$ will always carry a spin structure, which induces a decomposition 
\be \fld(M) \cong \bigoplus_{\eta \in H^1(M,\zt)}\fld^\eta(M),\ee
where $\fld^\eta(M)$ denotes field configurations compatible with the spin structure determined by the cochain $\eta$. While this is good to keep in the back of our minds, spin structure dpenedence will play a rather passive role in what follows. 

If $M$ and $N$ are two manifolds and there exists a closed manifold $S$ such that $\p M \ni S \in \p N$, then $M$ and $N$ can be glued along $S$, which induces a tensor product between field configurations on $M$ and those on $N$. However, when we do the gluing, we must take care to mod out by the degrees of freedom carried by the field configurations on $S$, by using a modified tensor product:
\be \label{eq:gluing} \fld(M\cup_SN) \cong \fld(M)\tp_{\fld(S)} \fld(N).\ee
Here, the use of $\tp_{\fld(S)}$ rather than the usual $\tp_\cc$ is for the same reason as the use of $\tp_{\End(Z)}$ in the usual coproduct isomorphism, which was discussed in detail back in \S \ref{sec:ccs}. For example, if $C$ is the cylinder and we let $\fld(C;a,b)$ denote the cylinder corresponding to the map $\fld(C;a,b) : a\ra b$ for $a,b\in \fld(S^1)$, we can write a resolution of the identity in the form
\be \label{eq:tuberes} \fld(C;a,b) = \bigoplus_{c\in \fld(S^1)} \fld(C;a,c) \tp_c \fld(C;c,b).\ee
Physically, this says that we can think of any cylinder as sum of stacks of two cylinders, provided that we mod out by the internal degrees of freedom living along the cut where the two cylinders are joined together. 

Additionally, two field configurations on the manifolds $M$ and $N$ can only be glued together along a manifold $S$ if their spin structures are compatible on $S$. That is, if we have two superspaces $\fld^\alpha(M)$ and $\fld^\beta(N)$ for $\alpha \in H^1(M,\zt), \beta\in H^1(N,\zt)$, then their tensor product satisfies
\be \fld^\alpha(M) \tp_{\fld(S)} \fld^\beta(N) \cong \bigoplus_{\gamma \in H^1(S,\zt)} \left( \fld^\alpha(M) \tp_{\fld^{\gamma}(S)} \fld^\beta(N) \right)  \delta_{\alpha|_S,\gamma}\delta_{\beta|_S,\gamma}.\ee

Consider a plane with $n$ different well-separated topological quasiparticles. As mentioned earlier, since the quasiparticles represent excitations above the usual ground-state field configurations, we can represent them as punctures in the spatial manifold, with the quasiparticle at a given puncture being defined in terms of the flux through the puncture and the puncture's boundary conditions. So then for us the relevant space of field configurations to consider is $\fld(S^2_n)$, where $S^2_n$ is the $n$-punctured $2$-sphere. 

We can now consider acting on $\fld(S^2_n)$ with the ``RG transformations'' described earlier. Under the RG flow, extra space is fused into / deleted from the area around the punctures, which is equivalent to gluing in cylinders (or tubes, or fubes) to the punctures, which by $\fld(C) = \fld(S^1)^*$, is equivalent to hitting all the field configurations on the punctures with elements of $\End(\fld(S^1))$. Thus, the effect of the RG-transformations on our $n$-punctured sphere can be encapsulated by a mapping 
\be RG: [\fld(C)]^n \ra \End(\fld(S^2_n)).\ee

However, not all elements in $\End(\fld(S^2_n))$ are physically allowable for the image of $[\fld(C)]^n$ under $RG$. Since the quasiparticles localized around each puncture are topological they are scale-invariant (we are working in gapped phases and setting the correlation length $\xi = 0$), and so the vector space of field configurations on $S^2_n$ needs to be invariant under the action of $RG$. 
That is, $RG$ transformations need to act as isomorphisms on $\fld(S^2_n)$, and so we actually have the more restricted condition that 
\be RG : [\fld(C)]^n \ra \Aut(\fld(S^2_n)). \ee

In what follows we will set $n=1$ to restrict our attention to how a single puncture is transformed under $RG$, which we can do without loss of generality. The image of $\fld(C)$ under the map $RG: \fld(C) \ra \text{Aut}(\fld(C))$ can be thought of as the formal definition of the fube algebra, namely the algebra whose scalars are drawn from $\cc$ and whose multiplication rule corresponds to the composition of maps in $\Aut(\fld(C))$, which is physically given by the stacking of fubes accomplished in the style of \eqref{eq:tuberes}. We will write the fube algebra as $\fube$ for lack of better notation. Since we have a way to associate elements in $\fube$ with automorphisms of $\fld(C)$, $\fld(C)$ is a $\fube$-module.

%Since all the elements in $\fube$ are isomorphisms on $\fld(C)$, $\fube$ is a ``representation'' of $\fld(S^2_1)$. The word ``representation'' is in quotes because $\fube$ isn't a group; it's actually an algebra, and so the more precise wording is to say that $\fld(C)$ is a $\fube$-{\it module}.% (for details on modules, see \S \ref{sec:morita}). 

Now we are prepared to discuss how to obtain the quasiparticle spectrum of the theory. Because $\fld(C)$ is a $\fube$-module, we can always decompose it into a direct sum of simple modules as
\be \fld(C) = \bigoplus_a \fld_a(C),\ee
which is just like our ability to decompose any representation into a direct sum of irreps. The simple modules $\fld_a(C)$ are the smallest vector spaces left invariant under the RG-flow induced by the action of $\fube$, and can thus be identified with the simple topological quasiparticles in the theory. 

We can also take a dual point of view with regards to the quasiparticles, and think of them as functions on $\fld(C)$, rather than as the simple sub-modules of $\fld(C)$. In this way of thinking, we define the maps $\Pi_a$ to be the canonical projectors from $\fld(C)$ to each of its submodules:
\be \Pi_a : \fld(C) \twoheadrightarrow \fld_a(C).\ee
We thus see that the $\Pi_a$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the simple modules of $\fld(C)$. In physical terms, the $\Pi_a$ are the idempotents which project onto states in which an $a$ quasiparticle is present. They are orthogonal:
\be \Pi_a \Pi_b \fld(C) = \delta_{ab}\fld_a(C)\ee
and are also central, since for any $f\in \fube$, we have 
\be f\Pi_a \fld(C) = f\fld_a(C) = \fld_a(C),\qquad \Pi_a f \fld(C) = \Pi_a \fld(C) = \fld_a(C),\ee
since $\fld(C)$ and by extension its simple submodules $\fld_a(C)$ are invariant under the action of $\fube$ by definition. 

\subsection{Finding the quasiparticle fusion rules}

Now that we've seen how to obtain the simple modules (central idempotents) and compute the quasiparticle spectrum, it's time to figure out how to derive the quasiparticle fusion rules.

Since quasiparticles are given by field configurations defined on copies of $S^1$s, the pair of pants bordism governs their fusion. If $Y$ is the pair of pants, then the field configurations come equipped with a natural action of $\fube \tp \fube \cong \Aut(\fld(S^2_2))$ from the left and $\fube \cong \Aut(\fld(C))$ from the right.\footnote{talking the talk, we would say that this makes $\fld(Y)$ into a $\fube^{\tp 2} - \fube$ bimodule.} Explicitly, for any $F,G \in \fube$, we can define a left action $(F \tp G) \fld(Y) \xrightarrow{\sim} \fld(Y)$ by stacking the superposition of tubes $F\tp G$ on top of $Y$, and for any $F \in \fube$ we can define a right action $\fld(Y) F \xrightarrow{\sim}  \fld(Y)$ by stacking the tubes $F$ onto the bottom of $Y$. Schematically, these actions look like 

%\be (F\tp G) f = \mathord{\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{piapibpop.pdf}}}},\quad f\in \fld(Y),\;F,G\in \fube\ee
and
\be fF =  \mathord{\vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{picpop.pdf}}}}\quad f\in \fld(Y),\; F\in\fube.\ee

Since we want the fusion space of two quasiparticles $a$ and $b$ to be invariant under hitting the top legs of the pants with $\Pi_a$ and $\Pi_b$, we define the fusion space $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ as the smallest nonzero vector space such that 
\be (\Pi_a\tp \Pi_b)\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) = \fld_{a\tp b}(Y)\ee
and 
\be \fld_{a\tp b}(Y)\Pi_{a\tp b}= \fld_{a\tp b}(Y),\ee
where $\Pi_{a\tp b}$ is the (not necessarily primitive) idempotent which projects onto the vector space $\fld_a(C)\tp \fld_b(C)$. 

At a formal level then, the contents of the fusion space $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ can be computed by formally taking the tensor product of modules $\fld_a(C)\tp \fld_b(C)$. This algebraic approach is occasionally useful, but in practice, there is a better way to compute $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$, namely by writing down the smallest collection of independent field configurations on $Y$ that are mapped to themselves under stacking $\Pi_a$ and $\Pi_b$ fubes on top of the pants. 

A few more miscellaneous comments. First, note that if the theory possesses non-Abelian quasiparticles, $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ will generically not be one-dimensional. Additionally, while we haven't talked about fermions much yet, $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ should always be thought of as a superspace -- like all the other vector spaces considered so far, it admits a decomposition into fermion-parity even and fermion-parity odd sectors. This opens up the possibility of having more structured fusion spaces: in bosonic theories, a generic fusion space is of the form $\cc^n$, whereas in fermionic theories it is $\cc^{n|m}$, depending on the number of even and odd basis vectors that generate $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$. \ethan{Naively, one might think that the larger fusion spaces (and their possible non-abelian structure) could find applications in quantum information/quantum computating. }


Of course, forming the vector space $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ is only half the battle, since we would like to express the fusion product $a\tp b$ in terms of other quasiparticles in the theory. This can be done by resolving the idempotent $\Pi_{a\tp b}$ as a collection of primitive idempotents. To illustrate why this is the correct strategy, we exploit the following decomposition of $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ into a direct sum 
%\be \fld_{a\tp b}(Y) = \bigoplus_{c_i} \fld_{c_i}(C),\ee
\be \fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \cong \bigoplus_{c} \fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \tp_{\fld(S^1)} \fld_c(C),\ee
where the sum is over all quasiparticles $c$ and as before, $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \tp_{\fld(S^1)} \fld_c(C)$ means ``glue the field configurations in $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$ on top of the field configurations in $\fld_c(C)$ and mod out by the space of field configurations on the $S^1$ that you used to do the gluing''. To figure out what $a\tp b$ is, we need to figure out what the fields $\fld_{c}(C)$ on the bottom leg of the pants are. But this is actually very straightforward: using the decomposition above, we see that we just have to compute $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \Pi_c$, where $\Pi_c$ runs over all primitive idempotents. Each time a product $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \Pi_c$ is nonzero, the quasiparticle $c$ is in the fusion product $a\tp b$, since then the space $\fld_c(C)$ admits a nonzero gluing with $\fld_{a\tp b}(Y)$. The number of times $c$ appears in $a\tp b$ is given by the fusion multiplicity
\be N^{ab}_c = \dim [\fld_{a\tp b}(Y) \Pi_c].\ee 
Note that in general, this will be a super-dimension, and will thus decompose as a sum $N^{ab}_c= [N^{ab}_c]^0 + [N^{ab}_c]^1$.

To run through an example of this, let's work out the toric code, as it is diagrammatically similar to the Ising theory we'll be addressing later. The vector space $\fld(C)$ is four-dimensional:
\be \fld(C) = \left\langle\; \FubeXXX\;, \FubesXs\;,\FubeXss\;, \FubessX\;\right\rangle.\ee

The quasiparticles are found by computing the simple modules (or idempotents) of $\fld(C)$. A quick look at the tube algebra tells us that it is Abelian and possesses a $\zt^2$ group algebra structure, and so its simple modules will all have only one basis vector and will biject onto the group elements of $\zt^2$. Explicitly, we label them as 
\be \fld_\unit(C) =  \FubeXXX + \FubesXs,\qquad \fld_m(C) =  \FubeXXX - \FubesXs,\ee
\be \fld_e(C) = \FubeXss + \FubessX, \qquad \fld_\psi(C) =\FubeXss - \FubessX \ee
In what follows, we will occasionally abuse notation somewhat by writing the vector space $\fld_a(C)$ as $a$. 

The fusion rules can now be calculated according the prescription outlined above. 
As an example, let's calculate the fusion product $e\tp e$. First, we need to find a linear combination of pants that are invariant under the action of $\Pi_e$ on the incoming pant legs. This is pretty straightforward, following the procedure outlined above: we simply take linear combinations of tensor products (superpositions) of tubes in $e$, connect them to form tubes in $e\tp e$, and add any extra allowable pictures on the remaining space of the pair of pants, which ensures that the space $e\tp e$ is invariant under the action of $\Pi_e \tp \Pi_e$. Thus, our initial guess for the basis vector for the fusion space $e\tp e$ is
\be \begin{aligned} \fld_{e\tp e}(Y) & = \left\langle \qqo + \qqm +\qtqo +\qtqm \right. \\ & \left. + \qqto +\qqtm+ \qtqto + \qtqtm\right\rangle. \end{aligned} \ee
However, not all of these pictures are independent, and thus the above linear combination of field configurations isn't actually an element in $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$, since $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$ is defined as field configurations on $Y$ modulo local relations. Explicitly, these relations are 
\be \label{eq:pantsrelns} \qtqtm \cong \qqo,\ee
\be \qtqm \cong \qqto,\ee
\be \qqtm \cong \qtqo,\ee
\be \qqm \cong \qtqto.\ee

Now we ask what sort of particles can result from the fusion. As mentioned earlier, they can be obtained by finding the idempotents $\Pi_c$ which, when acting on the bottom puncture of the pants as $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y) \Pi_c$, leave the basis vector for $e\tp e$ invariant. Since tubes fusing onto the bottom puncture can't have any charge degree of freedom, the fusion product must be either $\unit,m$, or some linear combination thereof. We therefore need to investigate what happens to the basis vector for $e\tp e$ when we fuse in a flux loop on the bottom leg, which can be done by examining the relations \eqref{eq:pantsrelns}. We see that since fusing in flux loops leaves the basis vector of $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$ invariant, $m$ can't be in $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$, since $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y) \Pi_m = 0$. However, we see that $\unit$ does work and that $\fld_{e\tp e}(Y) \Pi_\unit = \fld_{e\tp e}(Y)$, and so we've verified $e\tp e = \unit$. 

The other fusion rules are obtained in a similar fashion. For example, the basis vector for the vector space $\fld_{e\tp \psi}(Y)$ is 
\be \fld_{e\tp \psi}(Y) = \left\langle \qqo + \qtqo - \qqto - \qtqto\right\rangle. \ee
Using \eqref{eq:pantsrelns}, we see that in order to get the signs to work out so that the basis vector is left invariant, we need flux loops to be fused in with an extra minus sign. Therefore, we confirm that $e\tp \psi = m$.

\section{Kitaev Wire}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\ethan{not saying that this should be an appendix --- just dunno where to put it for now}
\subsubsection{Kitaev wire}
Here we propose a simple application of the above diagrammatic calculus. 
We will re-write the Kitaev-Majorana chain using this basis. 
The idea is to write down the natural anyon spin chain with this calculus and realize that it's exactly the Kitaev-Majorana chain. 
This elucidates the connection between Majorana zero modes and Ising anyons. 

The local ``on site" Hilbert space is spanned by two basis vectors
\begin{align}
    \CupSigma \qquad \text{and} \qquad \CupSigmadot
\end{align}
the first has even fermion parity, while the second has odd fermion parity.
The only terms one can contruct a Hamiltonian out of are
\begin{align}
\Id \qquad \text{and} \qquad \TwoLinedotdot
\end{align}
the first is the identity line, while the second is nontrivial and should be identified with $i \gamma_1 \gamma_2$, a Majorana bi-linear.
To see this, we can just check the action of the Hamiltonian on the basis vectors. 
\begin{align}
\TwoLinedotdot\; \times \; \CupSigma \; =\;  \CupSigma \quad \text{and} \quad \TwoLinedotdot\; \times \; \CupSigmadot \; =\;   - \; \CupSigmadot
\end{align}
\dave{Need to define ordering on vertices properly. I've been doing it by labeling the states first, then the operators have a natural ordering on them and I just begin counting from the last fermion on the state.}
For an $N$-site chain we have the basis of states,
\begin{align}
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigmadot \cdots \CupSigma\\
&\CupSigma \; \CupSigma \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigmadot\\
&\CupSigmadot \; \CupSigmadot \; \CupSigma \cdots \CupSigma
\end{align}
etcetera. Where there are $N$ cups appearing, and the fermion dots are ordered from right to left, and any number of them can appear.
If a state has an odd number of dots it has odd fermion parity, while an even number of dots has even fermion parity.
The Hamiltonian has two types of terms. One term mixes the states on site -- or within a single cup, while the other mixes nearest neighbour cups.
We will denote the onsite Hamiltonian terms by $H_{2j}$ and the the term which couples the nearest neighbour cups by $H_{2j+1}$.
Then the Hamiltonian takes on the form,
\begin{align}
H = - \sum_j\; t_j \; \;  \TwoLinedotdot_{\text{site $j$}}
\end{align}
Now in the completely staggered limit it's easy to see what the ground states are,
\begin{align}
\StaggaredGSEven \; \cdots \; \StaggaredGSEvenR  
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
\StaggaredGSOdd \; \cdots  \; \StaggaredGSEvenR
\end{align}
The first differing from the second by fermion parity.
Excitations are built by putting dots on the intermediate cups. 
A nice feature of the diagrammatic notation is that the ``delocalization" of femrion number is made manifest.
For example the fermion odd state does not have a femrion localized at either end, rather its free to slide from one end to the other.
When transforming back to the original basis, one sees that the state is actually an even superposition of all possible placements of an even number of fermions, similarly for the odd state.

\subsection{$\frac{1}{2}$E6 associators}
\label{E6Fsymbols}
There are four unitary solutions to the pentagon equation for $\frac{1}{2}$E6. They split into two sets, one pair has all positive quantum dimensions, while the other has negative quantum dimension on the $x$ particle. 
The solutions in each set are related by complex conjugation. 
Here we present one of the solutions with positive quantum dimensions on all particles. 
Several of the F symbols are trivial,
\begin{align}
F^{yyy}_y = F^{xyy}_x = F^{yyx}_x = F^{xxy}_y  = F^{yxx}_y = F^{xyx}_{\mathds{1}} = F^{xxy}_{\mathds{1}} = F^{yxx}_{\mathds{1}}= 1
\end{align}
Let $v_1, v_2$ be orthogonal unit vectors for the splitting space $V^{xx}_x$. 
Then we define the F-symbols via, e.g., $V^{xy}_x \tp V^{xx}_x  = F^{xyx}_x V^{xx}_x \tp V^{yx}_x$ in the basis $(v_1, v_2)^{T}$.
Explicitly we have,
\begin{align}
&F^{xyx}_x = \left(\begin{matrix}
0&1\\
1&0
\end{matrix} \right) \quad
F^{xxy}_x = \left(\begin{matrix}
0&-i\\
i&0
\end{matrix} \right) \quad
F^{yxx}_x = \left(\begin{matrix}
1&0\\
0&-1
\end{matrix} \right) 
\\
\\
&F^{xxx}_{\mathds{1}} = c_2^* \left(\begin{matrix}
1&-i\\
1&i
\end{matrix} \right) \quad
F^{xxx}_y = c_2^*\left(\begin{matrix}
1&-i\\
-1&-i
\end{matrix} \right), \quad \quad c_2  = \frac{e^{7 i \pi/12}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{align}

Lastly we have the F symbol when the four external labels are all $x$.
We write this one down in the basis $(0,y, v_1\tp v_1,v_1 \tp v_2, v_2 \tp v_1, v_2 \tp v_2)$, and have,
\begin{align}
F^{xxx}_x  = 
 \left(\begin{matrix}
\frac{1}{d} & \frac{1}{d} & \frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} & - \frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\frac{1}{d} & - \frac{1}{d} & \frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{c_1^*}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\frac{e^{- i \pi/4}}{\sqrt{d}} & 0 & -\frac{1}{d} & 0 & -i c_4^* & 0 \\
0 & \frac{e^{i \pi /4}}{\sqrt{d}} & 0 &c_4^* & 0 & \frac{ i}{d} \\
0 & \frac{e^{- i \pi /4}}{\sqrt{d}} & 0 & -\frac{1}{d} & 0 & i c_4^* \\ 
\frac{e^{i \pi /4}}{\sqrt{d}} & 0 & c_4^* & 0 & - \frac{i}{d} & 0
\end{matrix} \right) \\
d = 1 + \sqrt{3} \quad \quad c_1 = \frac{e^{-5 i \pi/6} }{\sqrt{d}} \quad \quad c_4 = \frac{e^{-i \pi/4}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{align}
